<br /><i>OLD MAN OF THE HILLS</i></h2>
<p>A girl in crumpled linen slacks skidded to a fast
stop on the polished floor of the <i>Star</i> business office.
With a flourish, she pushed a slip of paper through
the bars of the treasurer&rsquo;s cage. She grinned beguilingly
at the man who was totaling a long column of
figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the morning, Mr. Peters,&rdquo; she chirped.
&ldquo;How about cashing a little check for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bald-headed, tired looking man peered carefully
at the crisp rectangle of paper. Regretfully he
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Miss Parker. I&rsquo;d like to do it, but orders
are orders. Your father said I wasn&rsquo;t to pass out a
penny without his okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m stony broke! I&rsquo;m destitute!&rdquo; The blue
eyes became eloquent, pleading. &ldquo;My allowance
doesn&rsquo;t come due for another ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not talk it over with your father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>Penny retrieved the check and tore it to bits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
already worked on Dad until I&rsquo;m blue in the face,&rdquo; she
grumbled. &ldquo;Talking to a mountain gives one a lot
more satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know your father gives you almost
everything you want,&rdquo; the treasurer teased. &ldquo;You
have a car of your own&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no gas to run it,&rdquo; Penny cut in. &ldquo;Why, I
work like a galley slave helping Dad build up the circulation
of this newspaper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have brought the <i>Star</i> many new subscribers,&rdquo;
Mr. Peters agreed warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always remember
that fine story you wrote about the Vanishing
Houseboat Mystery. It was one of the best this
paper ever published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being the talented, only daughter
of a prosperous newspaper owner if you can&rsquo;t cash
in on it now and then?&rdquo; Penny went on. &ldquo;Why, the
coffers of this old paper fairly drip gold, but do I ever
get any of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you have a few dollars,&rdquo; Mr. Peters offered
unexpectedly. &ldquo;Enough to tide you over until the
day your allowance falls due. You see, I know how
it is because I have a daughter of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s chubby, freckled face brightened. Then
the light faded. She asked doubtfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t intend to give me the money out of
your own pocket, Mr. Peters?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare go against your
father&rsquo;s orders, Penny. He said no more of your
checks were to be cashed without his approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfolding several crisp new bills from his wallet,
the treasurer offered them to Penny. She gazed at
the money with deep longing, then firmly pushed it
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Peters, but it has to be Dad&rsquo;s money
or none. You see, I have a strict code of honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; replied the treasurer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll struggle on somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, Penny turned away from the
cage. She was a slim, blue-eyed girl whose enthusiasms
often carried her into trouble. Her mother
was dead, but though she had been raised by Mrs.
Weems, a faithful housekeeper, she was not in the
least spoiled. Nevertheless, because her father, Anthony
Parker, publisher of the <i>Riverview Star</i> was
indulgent, she usually had her way about most matters.
From him she had learned many details of the
newspaper business. In fact, having a flare for reporting,
she had written many of the paper&rsquo;s finest stories.</p>
<p>Penny was a friendly, loveable little person. Not
for long could she remain downhearted. As she
walked down the long hallway, its great expanse of
polished floor suddenly looked as inviting as an ice
pond. With a quick little run she slid its length.
And at the elevator corner she collided full-tilt with
a bent old man who hobbled along on a crooked
hickory cane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m terribly sorry!&rdquo; Penny apologized. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know anyone was coming. I shouldn&rsquo;t have
taken this hall on high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unexpected collision had winded the old man.
He staggered a step backwards and Penny grasped
his arm to offer support. She could not fail to stare.
Never before in the <i>Star</i> office had she seen such a
queer looking old fellow. He wore loose-fitting,
coarse garments with heavy boots. His hair, snow
white, had not been cut in many weeks. The grotesque
effect was heightened by a straw hat several
sizes too small which was perched atop his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny repeated. &ldquo;I guess I didn&rsquo;t
know where I was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like we is in the same boat, Miss,&rdquo; replied
the old man in a cracked voice. &ldquo;&rsquo;Lows as how I
don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; my own self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I can help you. Are you looking
for someone in this building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man took a grimy sheet of paper from a
tattered coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find the feller who will print this advertisement
for me,&rdquo; he explained carefully. &ldquo;I want
everybody who takes the newspaper to read it. I got
cash money to pay for it too.&rdquo; He drew a greasy
bill from an ancient wallet and waved it proudly before
Penny. &ldquo;Ye see, Miss, I got cash money. I
ain&rsquo;t no moocher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Penny hid a smile. Not only did the old man look
queer but his conversation was equally quaint. She
thought that he must come from an isolated hill community
many miles distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the way to the ad department,&rdquo; she
offered, guiding him down the hall. &ldquo;I see you have
your advertisement written out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo; The old man hobbled along beside
her. &ldquo;My old woman wrote it all down. She was
well edijikated before we got hitched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proudly he offered Penny the paper which bore
several lines of neatly inscribed script. The advertisement,
long and awkwardly worded, offered for
sale an old spinning wheel, an ancient loom and a set
of wool carders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old woman used to be one o&rsquo; the best weavers
in Hobostein county,&rdquo; the old man explained with
pride. &ldquo;She could make a man a pair o&rsquo; jeans that&rsquo;d
wear like they had growed to his hide. But they ain&rsquo;t
no call for real weavin&rsquo; no more. Everything is
cheapened down machine stuff these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo; Penny questioned curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and my old woman was born and raised in the
Red River Valley. Ever been there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the purtiest spots God ever made,&rdquo; the
old man said proudly. &ldquo;You never seen such green
pastures, an&rsquo; the hills kinda take your breath away.
Only at night there&rsquo;s strange creatures trackin&rsquo;
through the woods, and some says there&rsquo;s haunts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced quickly at her companion.
&ldquo;Haunts?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Before the old man could answer they had reached
the want-ad counter. An employee of the paper immediately
appeared to accept the advertisement. His
rapid-fire questions as he counted words and assessed
charges, bewildered the old hillman. Penny supplied
the answers as best she could. However, in her haste
to be finished with the task, she forgot to have the old
fellow leave name and address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying something about haunts,&rdquo; she
reminded him eagerly as they walked away from the
desk. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really believe in ghosts do you,
Mister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Malcom,&rdquo; the old man supplied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my name and there ain&rsquo;t a better one in Hobostein
County. So you be interested in haunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I am,&rdquo; Penny admitted, her eyes dancing.
&ldquo;I like all types of mystery. Just lead me to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s something that will make your pretty
eyes pop.&rdquo; Chuckling, the old man fumbled in his
pocket and produced a worn newspaper clipping.
Penny saw that it had been clipped from the
Hobostein County Weekly. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars reward offered for any information
leading to the capture of the Headless
Horseman. For particulars see J. Burmaster, Sleepy
Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> a strange advertisement,&rdquo; Penny commented
aloud. &ldquo;The only Headless Horseman to my
knowledge was the famous Galloping Hessian in the
story, &lsquo;Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&rsquo; But in reality
such things can&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but we got one in
the valley just the same. An&rsquo; if what folks says is so,
that Headless Horseman&rsquo;s likely to make a heap o&rsquo;
trouble fer someone before he&rsquo;s through his hauntin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared soberly into the twinkling blue eyes
of her aged companion. As a character he completely
baffled her. Did he mean what he said or was he
merely trying to lead her on with hints of mystery?
At any rate, the bait was too tempting to resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Exactly what do you
know about this advertisement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Nary a thing, Miss. But there&rsquo;s haunts
at Sleepy Hollow and don&rsquo;t you think there ain&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em myself from Witching Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is Witching Rock?&rdquo; Even the words
intrigued Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jest a place on Humpy Hill lookin&rsquo; down over the
Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding her companion none too willing to impart
additional information, Penny reread the advertisement.
The item had appeared in the Hobostein
County paper only the previous week. The words
themselves rather than the offer of a reward enchanted
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headless Horseman&mdash;Witching Rock!&rdquo; she
thought excitedly. &ldquo;Why, even the names scream of
mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloud she urged: &ldquo;Mr. Malcom, do tell me more
about the matter. Who is Mr. Burmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Penny glanced up from the
advertisement and stared in astonishment. The
elderly man no longer stood beside her. Not a soul
was in the long empty hall. The old man of the hills
had vanished as quietly as if spirited away by an unseen
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>PLANS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now what became of that old man?&rdquo; Penny
asked herself in perplexity. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear him steal
away. He couldn&rsquo;t have vanished into thin air! Or
did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking that Mr. Malcom might have gone back
to the want-ad department, she hastily returned there.
To her anxious inquiry, the clerk responded with a
grin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Old Whiskers hasn&rsquo;t been here. If you find
him, ask for his address. He forgot to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly disturbed, Penny ran down the hall
which gave exit to the street. Breathlessly she asked
the elevator attendant if he had seen an old man leave
the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow with a long white beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a cane. Which way did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did see him?&rdquo; Penny demanded impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he went out the door a minute or two ago.
He was talking to himself like he was a bit cracked in
the head. He was chuckling as if he knew a great
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m it,&rdquo; Penny muttered.</p>
<p>She darted through the revolving doors to the
street. With the noon hour close at hand throngs of
persons poured from the various offices. Amid the
bustling, hurrying crowd she saw no one who remotely
resembled the old man of the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped away on purpose!&rdquo; she thought half-resentfully.
&ldquo;He gave me the newspaper clipping
just to stir my interest, and then left without explaining
a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abandoning the search as hopeless, Penny again
reread the clipping. Five hundred dollars offered for
information leading to the capture of a Headless
Horseman! Why, it sounded fantastic. But the advertisement
actually had appeared in a country newspaper.
Therefore, it must have some basis of fact.</p>
<p>Still mulling the matter over in her mind, Penny
climbed a long flight of stairs to the <i>Star</i> news room.
Near the door stood an empty desk. For many years
that desk had been occupied by Jerry Livingston,
crack reporter, now absent on military leave. It gave
Penny a tight feeling to see the covered typewriter,
for she and Jerry had shared many grand times together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>She went quickly on, past a long row of desks where
other reporters tapped out their stories. She nodded
to Mr. DeWitt, the city editor, waved at Salt Sommers,
photographer, and entered her father&rsquo;s private
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; she greeted him cheerfully. &ldquo;Busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony Parker put aside the mouthpiece of a
dictaphone machine to smile fondly at his one and
only child. He was a tall, lean man and a recent
illness had left him even thinner than before.</p>
<p>Penny sank into an upholstered chair in front of
her father&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s money you want,&rdquo; began Mr. Parker, &ldquo;the
answer is no! Not one cent until your allowance is
due. And no sob story please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad.&rdquo; Penny shot him an injured look.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t even thinking of money&mdash;at least not such
a trivial amount as exchanges hands on my allowance
day. Nothing less than five hundred dollars interests
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I aim to earn it myself,&rdquo; Penny assured him
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe by catching a Headless Horseman,&rdquo; Penny
grinned mischievously. &ldquo;It seems that one is galloping
wild out Red Valley way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Red Valley? Never heard of the place.&rdquo; Mr.
Parker began to show irritation. &ldquo;Penny, what are
you talking about anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; explained Penny, spreading the clipping on
the desk. &ldquo;An old fellow who looked like Rip Van
Winkle gave it to me. Then he disappeared before
I could ask any questions. What do you think, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker read the advertisement at a glance.
&ldquo;Bunk!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Pure bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad,&rdquo; protested Penny hotly. &ldquo;It was printed
in the Hobostein Weekly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who published it or where. I still say
&lsquo;bunk!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that the same word you used not so long
ago when I tried to tell you about a certain Witch
Doll?&rdquo; teased Penny. &ldquo;I started off on what looked
like a foolish chase, but I came back dragging one of
the best news stories the <i>Star</i> ever published.
Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance you&rsquo;ll ever let me forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I have a hunch,&rdquo; Penny went on, ignoring
the jibe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big story in this Headless Horseman
business! I just feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d like to have me assign you the
task of tracking down your Front Page gem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking my language!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, can&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s only a joke?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
asked in exasperation. &ldquo;The Headless Horseman of
Sleepy Hollow! That story was written years ago by
a man named Washington Irving. Or didn&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve read the &lsquo;Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Penny retorted loftily. &ldquo;I remember one of the
characters was Ichabod Crane. He was chased by the
Headless Horseman and nearly died of fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice bit of fiction,&rdquo; commented Mr. Parker.
He tapped the newspaper clipping. &ldquo;And so is this.
The best place for it is in the scrap basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Penny leaped forward to rescue
the precious clipping. Carefully she folded it into her
purse. &ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m convinced Sleepy Hollow must be
a real place. Why can&rsquo;t I go there to interview Mr.
Burmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say Burmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the person who offers the reward. He signed
himself J. Burmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That name is rather familiar,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Wonder if it could be John Burmaster,
the millionaire? Probably not. But I recall
that a man by that name built an estate called Sleepy
Hollow somewhere in the hill country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Penny triumphantly. &ldquo;You see the
story does have substance after all! May I make the
trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you find Burmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A big estate shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to locate. I can
trace him through the Hobostein Weekly. What do
you say, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is for Mrs. Weems to decide. Now
scram out of here! I have work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for letting me go,&rdquo; laughed Penny, giving
him a big hug. &ldquo;Now about finances&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll discuss
that angle later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blowing her father an airy kiss, she pranced out of
the office.</p>
<p>Penny fairly trod on clouds as she raced toward
the home of her chum, Louise Sidell. Her dark-haired
chum sat listlessly on the porch reading a book,
but she jumped to her feet as she saw her friend.
From the way Penny took the steps at one leap she
knew there was important news to divulge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; she demanded alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop, skip and count three!&rdquo; laughed Penny.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to launch forth into a grand and glorious
adventure. How would you like to go in search
of a Headless Horseman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any kind of a creature suits me,&rdquo; chuckled Louise.
&ldquo;When do we start and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to a map and I&rsquo;ll try to answer your questions.
Our first problem is to find a place called Red
Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>For a half hour the two girls poured over a state
map. Hobostein County was an area close by, while
Red Valley proved to be an isolated little locality less
than a day&rsquo;s journey from Riverview. Penny was
further encouraged to learn that the valley she proposed
to visit had been settled by Dutch pioneers and
that many of the original families still had descendants
living there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be an interesting trip even if we don&rsquo;t run
into any mystery,&rdquo; Louise said philosophically. &ldquo;Are
you sure you can go, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pretty sure. Dad said it was up to Mrs.
Weems to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise gave her chum a sideways glance. &ldquo;That
seems like a mighty big &lsquo;if&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll bring her around somehow. Pack your
suitcase, Lou. We&rsquo;ll start tomorrow morning bright
and early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Penny spoke with confidence, she was less
certain of her powers as she entered her own home a
few minutes later. She found Mrs. Weems, the stout,
middle-aged housekeeper in the kitchen making
cookies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now please don&rsquo;t gobble any of that raw dough!&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems remonstrated as the girl reached for one
of the freshly cut circles. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait until
they&rsquo;re baked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny perched herself on the sink counter. Reminded
that her heels were making marks on the cabinet
door, she drew them up beneath her and balanced
like an acrobat. Forthwith she launched into a glowing
tale of her morning&rsquo;s activities. The story failed
to bring a responsive warmth from the housekeeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, I can&rsquo;t make sense out of what you&rsquo;re
saying!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Headless Horsemen, my
word! I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s lost your head.
The ideas you do get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems sadly heaved a deep sigh. Since the
death of Mrs. Parker many years before, she had assumed
complete charge of the household. However,
the task of raising Penny had been almost too much
for the patient woman. Though she loved the girl
as her own, there were times when she felt that running
a three-ring circus would be much easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I plan to start for Red Valley by train
early tomorrow,&rdquo; said Penny briskly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably
catch the 9:25 if I can get up in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has your father said you may go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems smiled grimly. &ldquo;Then the matter is
settled. I shall put my foot down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; Penny wailed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
ruin all our plans. The trip means so much to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that argument before,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Weems, unmoved. &ldquo;I see no reason why I should
allow you to start off on such a wild chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I expect to get a dandy story for Dad&rsquo;s paper!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only an excuse,&rdquo; sighed the housekeeper.
&ldquo;The truth is that you crave adventure and excitement.
It&rsquo;s a trait which unfortunately you inherited
from your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny decided to play her trump card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, Red Valley is one of those picturesque
hidden localities where families have gone on
for generation after generation. The place must
fairly swim with antiques. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have
me buy a few for you while I&rsquo;m there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite her intentions, Mrs. Weems displayed interest.
As Penny very well knew, collecting antiques
had become an absorbing hobby with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Malcom has a spinning wheel for sale,&rdquo; Penny
went on, pressing home the advantage she had gained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him if I can and buy it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your schemes are as transparent as glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will let me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably will,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
learned to my sorrow that in any event you usually
get your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny danced out of the kitchen to a telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all set,&rdquo; she gleefully told Louise. &ldquo;We leave
early tomorrow morning for Red Valley. And if I
don&rsquo;t earn that five hundred dollar reward then my
name isn&rsquo;t Penny Gumshoe Parker!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>INTO THE VALLEY</i></h2>
<p>The slow train crept around a bend and puffed
to a standstill at the drowsing little station of Hobostein.
Louise and Penny, their linen suits mussed
from many weary hours of sitting, were the only passengers
to alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday it seemed like a good idea,&rdquo; sighed
Louise. &ldquo;But now, I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped aside to avoid a dolly-truck which
was being pushed down the deserted platform by a
station attendant. She too felt ill at ease in this strange
town and the task she had set for herself suddenly
seemed a silly one. But not for anything in the world
would she make such an admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll find the newspaper office,&rdquo; she said
briskly. &ldquo;This town is so small it can&rsquo;t be far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried their over-night bags into the stuffy
little station. The agent, in shirt sleeves and green
eye shade, speared a train order on the spindle and
then glanced curiously at the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Please tell us how to find
the offices of the Hobostein Weekly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a piece down the street,&rdquo; directed the
agent. &ldquo;Go past the old town pump, and the livery
stable. A red brick building. Best one in town. You
can&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise took their bags and crossed to
the shady side of the street. A horse and carriage had
been tied to a hitching post and by contrast an expensive,
new automobile was parked beside it. The
unpaved road was thick with dust; the broken sidewalk
was coated with it, as were the little plots of
struggling grass.</p>
<p>In the entire town few persons were abroad. An
old lady in a sunbonnet busily loaded boxes of groceries
into a farm wagon. The only other sign of activity
was at the livery stable where a group of men
slouched on the street benches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we pass there?&rdquo; Louise murmured. &ldquo;Those
men are staring as if they never saw a girl before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; said Penny, undisturbed.</p>
<p>Two doors beyond the livery stable stood a newly
built red brick building. In gold paint on the expanse
of unwashed plate glass window were the
words: &ldquo;Hobostein Weekly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>With heads high the girls ran the gantlet of loungers
and reached the newspaper office. Through the
plate glass they glimpsed a large, cluttered room
where desks, bins of type, table forms and a massive
flat-bed press all seemed jammed together. A rotund
man they took to be the editor was talking to a customer
in a loud voice. Neither took the slightest notice
of the girls as they pushed open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are or how much money you
have,&rdquo; the editor was saying heatedly. &ldquo;I run my
paper as I please&mdash;see! If you don&rsquo;t like my editorials
you don&rsquo;t have to read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pin-headed, stubborn Dutchman!&rdquo; the
other man retorted. &ldquo;It makes no difference to me
what you run in your stupid old weekly, providing
you don&rsquo;t deliberately try to stir up the people of this
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worrying about your pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the largest tax payer in the valley. If there&rsquo;s
an assessment for repairs on the Huntley Lake Dam
it will cost me thousands of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you had an ounce of sense, you&rsquo;d see that
without the repairs your property may not be worth
a nickel! If these rains keep up, the dam&rsquo;s apt to give
way, and your property would go in the twinkling
of an eye. Not that I&rsquo;m worried about your property.
But I am concerned about the folks who are
still living in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Schultz, you&rsquo;re a calamity-howler!&rdquo; the other accused.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger of the dam giving way
and you know it. By writing these hot editorials
you&rsquo;re just trying to stir up public feeling&mdash;you&rsquo;re
hoping to shake me down so I&rsquo;ll underwrite a costly
and unnecessary repair bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor pushed back his chair and arose. His
voice remained controlled but his eyes snapped like
fire brands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of this office!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;The Hobostein
Weekly can do without your subscription.
You&rsquo;ve been a pain to this community ever since
you came. Good afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk like that to me, Byron Schultz!&rdquo;
the other man began hotly. Then his gaze fell upon
Louise and Penny who stood just inside the door.
Jamming on his hat, he went angrily from the building.</p>
<p>The editor crumpled a sheet of paper and hurled it
into a waste basket. The act seemed to restore his
good humor, for with a wry grin he then turned toward
the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Penny scarcely knew how to begin. Sliding into
a chair beside the editor&rsquo;s desk, she fumbled in her
purse for the advertisement clipped from the Hobostein
Weekly. To her confusion she could not find it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose something?&rdquo; the editor inquired kindly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my trouble too. Last week we misplaced the
copy for Gregg&rsquo;s Grocery Store and was Jake hoppin&rsquo;
mad! Found it again just before the Weekly went
to press.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; said Penny triumphantly. She placed
the clipping on Mr. Schultz&rsquo; desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I had enough of that man in one day!&rdquo; the
editor snorted. &ldquo;The old skinflint never paid me for
the ad either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is J. Burmaster?&rdquo; Penny inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; The editor&rsquo;s gray-blue eyes sent out
little flashes of fire. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most egotistical, thick-headed,
muddle-brained property owner in this community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the man who was just here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was John Burmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he lives in Hobostein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not,&rdquo; said the editor with emphasis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
bad enough having him seven miles away. You don&rsquo;t
mean to tell me you haven&rsquo;t seen Sleepy Hollow
estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. She explained that as
strangers to the town, she and Louise had made no
trips or inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleepy Hollow is quite a show place,&rdquo; the editor
went on grudgingly. &ldquo;Old Burmaster built it about
a year ago. Imported an architect and workmen from
the city. The house has a long bridge leading up to
it, and is supposed to be like the Sleepy Hollow of
legend. Only the legend kinda backfired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re speaking about the Headless Horseman?&rdquo;
Penny leaned forward in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Burmaster built his house, the old skinflint
didn&rsquo;t calculate on getting a haunt to go with it,&rdquo; the
editor chuckled. &ldquo;Served him right for being so
muleish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the story of the Headless Horseman?&rdquo;
Penny asked. &ldquo;Has Mr. Burmaster actually offered a
five hundred dollar reward for its capture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d give double the amount to get that Horseman
off his neck!&rdquo; chuckled the editor. &ldquo;But folks
up Delta way aren&rsquo;t so dumb. The reward never will
be collected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Delta the name of a town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s up the valley a piece,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Schultz. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very familiar with our
layout here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend and I come from Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s like this.&rdquo; The editor drew a
crude map for the girls. &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow estate is
situated in a sort of &lsquo;V&rsquo; shaped valley. Just below it
is the little town of Delta, and on below that, a hamlet
called Raven. We&rsquo;re at the foot of the valley, so to
speak. Huntley Lake and the dam are just above
Sleepy Hollow estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there really danger that the dam will give
way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you want my opinion, read the Hobostein
Weekly,&rdquo; answered the editor. &ldquo;The dam won&rsquo;t
wash out tomorrow or the next day, but if these rains
keep on, the whole valley&rsquo;s in danger. But try to
pound any sense into Burmaster&rsquo;s thick head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You started to tell me about the Headless Horseman,&rdquo;
Penny reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I now?&rdquo; smiled the editor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recollect
it myself. Fact is, Burmaster&rsquo;s ghost troubles don&rsquo;t
interest me one whit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve come all the way from Riverview just
to find out about the Headless Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calculate on earning that reward?&rdquo; The editor&rsquo;s
eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t want to waste time trying to get
second-hand information. Burmaster&rsquo;s the man for
you to see. Talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you talk to Burmaster,&rdquo; the editor said with
finality. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t tell him I sent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will we find the man?&rdquo; Penny was
rather dismayed to have the interview end before it
was well launched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his car is parked down the street,&rdquo; the editor
answered carelessly. &ldquo;Everyone in town knows Burmaster.
I&rsquo;d talk to you longer only I&rsquo;m so busy this
afternoon. Burmaster is the one to tell you his own
troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Thus dismissed, the girls could do nothing but
thank the editor and leave the newspaper building.
Dubiously they looked up and down the street. The
fine new car they had noticed a little while earlier
no longer was parked at the curb. Nor was there
any sign of the man who had just left the newspaper
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do is inquire for him,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>At a grocery store farther down the street they
paused to ask if Mr. Burmaster had been seen. The
store keeper finished grinding a pound of coffee for
a customer and then answered Penny&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burmaster?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why, yes, he was
in town, but he pulled out about five minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve just missed him!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burmaster&rsquo;s on his way to Sleepy Hollow by this
time,&rdquo; the store keeper agreed. &ldquo;You might catch
him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we get to Sleepy Hollow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a train. Only runs once a day
though. And it went through about half an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the train we came in on. Isn&rsquo;t there a
car one can hire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know of any. Clem Williams has some
good horses though. He keeps the livery stable down
the street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Their faces very long, the girls picked up their
overnight bags and went outside again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew this trip would be a wash-out,&rdquo; said Louise
disconsolately. &ldquo;Here we are, stuck high and dry
until our train comes in tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why give up so easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re licked, that&rsquo;s why. We&rsquo;ve missed Mr. Burmaster
and we can&rsquo;t go to Sleepy Hollow after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed thoughtfully down the street at Clem
Williams&rsquo; livery stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we go to Sleepy Hollow?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rent horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise waxed sarcastic. &ldquo;To be sure. We can
canter along balancing these overnight bags on the
pommel of our saddles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to leave our luggage behind,&rdquo; Penny
planned briskly. &ldquo;The most essential things we can
wrap up in knapsacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a good rider,&rdquo; Louise complained.
&ldquo;The last time we rode a mile I couldn&rsquo;t walk for a
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven miles isn&rsquo;t so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven miles!&rdquo; Louise gasped. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll last,&rdquo; chuckled Penny confidently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see to that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am curious to see Sleepy Hollow estate,&rdquo; Louise
admitted with reluctance. &ldquo;All that talk about the
Huntley Dam interested me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Headless Horseman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That part rather worries me. Penny, do you realize
that if we go to Sleepy Hollow we may run into
more than we bargain for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed and grasping her chums arm, pulled
her down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I hope,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Unless
Sleepy Hollow lets us down shamefully, our adventure
is just starting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>A STRANGER OF THE ROAD</i></h2>
<p>Even for late September it was a warm day. The
horses plodded slowly up a steep, winding trail heavily
canopied with yellowing maple leaves. Louise and
Penny swished angrily at the buzzing mosquitoes and
tried to urge their tired mounts to a faster pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned you this trip would be slaughter,&rdquo; Louise
complained, ducking to avoid a tree limb. &ldquo;Furthermore,
I suspect we&rsquo;re lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we be, when we haven&rsquo;t turned off the
trail?&rdquo; Penny called over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She rode ahead on a sorry looking nag appropriately
named Bones. The animal was more easily managed
than the skittish mare Louise had chosen at Williams&rsquo;
Livery Stable, but had an annoying appetite
for foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Williams&rsquo; directions were clear enough,&rdquo;
Penny resumed. &ldquo;He said to follow this trail until
we reach a little town named Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Providing we survive that long,&rdquo; Louise interposed
crossly. &ldquo;How far from Delta to Sleepy
Hollow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than two or three miles. And once we
get down out of these hills into the valley, the going
should be much easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny spoke with forced cheerfulness. In truth,
she too had wearied of the trip which in the last hour
had become sheer torture instead of adventure. Her
freckled face was blotched with mosquito bites.
Every hairpin had been jolted from her head and
muscles fairly screamed a protest. Louise, on an unruly
horse, had taken even more punishment.</p>
<p>Penny gave Bones a dig in the ribs. The horse
quickened his step, weaving a corkscrew path around
the trunks of the giant trees.</p>
<p>Gradually the tangle of brush and trees began to
thin out. They came at last to a clearing at the brow
of the hill. Penny drew rein beside a huge, moss-covered
rock. Below stretched a beautiful rich, green
valley through which wound a flood-swollen river.
From the chimney-tops of a cluster of houses smoke
curled lazily, blending into the blue rim of the distant
hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a prettier little valley?&rdquo; Penny
asked, her interest reviving. &ldquo;That must be Delta
down there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Louise was too weary to look or answer. She slid
out of the saddle and tossed the reins over a tree limb.
Near by a spring gushed from between the rocks.
She walked stiffly to it and drank deeply of the cool
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, the valley looks exactly as I hoped it would!&rdquo;
Penny went on eagerly. &ldquo;It has a dreamy, drowsy
atmosphere, just as Irving described the Sleepy Hollow
of legend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise bent to drink of the spring again. She
sponged her hot face with a dampened handkerchief.
Pulling off shoes and stockings, she let the cool water
trickle over her bare feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to legend, the valley and its inhabitants
were bewitched,&rdquo; Penny rambled on. &ldquo;Why, the
Indians considered these hills as the abode of Spirits.
Sometimes the Spirits took mischievous delight in
wreaking trouble upon the villagers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s voice trailed off. From far down the hillside
came the faint thud of hoofbeats. The girl&rsquo;s
attention became fixed upon a moving horseman on
the road below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; inquired Louise impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
try to tell me you&rsquo;ve seen the Headless Horseman already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve certainly seen a horseman! My, can that fellow
ride!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Louise picked up her shoes and hobbled over the
stones to the trail&rsquo;s end. Through a gap in the trees
she gazed down upon a winding turnpike fringed on
either side with an old-fashioned rail fence. A horseman,
mounted on a roan mare, rode bareback at a full
run. As the girls watched in admiration, the mare
took the low fence in one magnificent leap and
crashed out of sight through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Penny,&rdquo; Louise acknowledged.
&ldquo;What wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be able to ride like that!
One of the villagers, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hoofbeats rapidly died away. Louise turned
wearily around, intending to remount her horse. She
stared in astonishment. Where the mare had grazed,
there now was only trampled grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my horse?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
White Foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirited away by the witches maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time for any of your feeble jokes, Penny
Parker! That stupid horse must have wandered off
while I was admiring your old valley and that rider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny remained undisturbed. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll find the
mare all right,&rdquo; she said confidently. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be
far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls thought that they heard a crashing of
underbrush to the left of the trail. Investigation did
not disclose that the horse had gone that way. They
could hear no hoofbeats, nor was any of the grass
trampled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet White Foot&rsquo;s on her way back to Williams&rsquo;
Stable by this time,&rdquo; Louise declared crossly. &ldquo;Such
luck!&rdquo; She sat down on a stone and put on her shoes
and stockings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hear the horse run off, Lou. She can&rsquo;t
be far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you find her. I&rsquo;ve had all I can stand. I&rsquo;m
tired and I&rsquo;m hungry and I wish I&rsquo;d never come on
this wild, silly chase.&rdquo; Tears began to trickle down
Louise&rsquo;s heat-mottled face.</p>
<p>Penny slid down from Bones and patted her chum&rsquo;s
arm awkwardly. Louise pulled away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t give me any pep talk or I&rsquo;ll simply
bawl,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;What am I going to do without
a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s easy, Lou. We&rsquo;ll ride double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to Williams&rsquo; Stable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not tonight. It&rsquo;s getting late and after coming
this far it would be foolish to turn around and
start right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be the most sensible act of our lives,&rdquo;
Louise retorted. &ldquo;But then I might know you&rsquo;d insist
on pushing on. You and Christopher Columbus
have a lot in common!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to find out about that Headless Horseman,
didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, I guess,&rdquo; Louise sighed, getting up from
the rock. &ldquo;I just came along because I&rsquo;m weak
minded! Well, what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride down to Delta and try to get a room for
the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s silence gave consent. She climbed up behind
Penny on Bones and they jogged down the trail
toward the turnpike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer how White Foot sneaked away without
making a sound,&rdquo; Penny presently commented. &ldquo;According
to the old legend strange things did happen
in the Sleepy Hollow valley. The Spirit was supposed
to wreak all sorts of vexations upon the inhabitants.
Sometimes he would take the shape of a bear
or a deer and lead bewildered hunters a merry chase
through the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who is bewitched,&rdquo; Louise broke
in. &ldquo;And if you ask me, you&rsquo;ve been that way ever
since you were born. There&rsquo;s a little spark&mdash;something
deep within you that keeps saying: &lsquo;Go on,
Penny. Sic &rsquo;em, Penny! Maybe you&rsquo;ll find a mystery!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt that. You&rsquo;ve turned up some
dandy news stories for your father&rsquo;s paper. But this
is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place we both know there&rsquo;s no such
thing as a Headless Horseman. It must all be a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you call that advertisement in the Hobostein
paper a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been. We don&rsquo;t know many of the
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Penny guided Bones
onto the wide turnpike. Before she could add more,
Louise&rsquo;s grasp about her waist suddenly tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Penny! Someone&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew rein. Distinctly, both girls could hear
the clop-clop of approaching hoofbeats. Their hope
that it might be White Foot was quickly dashed. A
moment later the same horseman they had observed a
few minutes earlier, swung around the bend.</p>
<p>The young man rapidly overtook the girls. From
the way he grinned, they suspected that they presented
a ridiculous sight as they rocked along on
Bones&rsquo; swaying back. He sat his own horse, a handsome
roan, with easy grace.</p>
<p>Louise tugged at her skirt which kept creeping
above her knees. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s laughing at us!&rdquo; she muttered
under her breath.</p>
<p>The rider cantered up, then deliberately slowed his
horse to a walk. Louise stole a quick sideways glance.
The young man was dark-haired, about twenty-six
and very good looking. His flashing brown eyes
were friendly and so was his voice as he spoke a
cheery, &ldquo;&rsquo;Lo, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Penny responded briefly. Louise immediately
nudged her in the ribs, a silent warning that
she considered the stranger &ldquo;fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Penny twisted sideways in the saddle
the better to look at their road companion. He wore
whipcord riding breeches and highly polished boots.
From the well-tailored cut of his clothes she decided
that he too was a comparative stranger to the hill
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not looking for a horse by any chance, are you?&rdquo;
the young man inquired.</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s snub nose came down out of the sky. &ldquo;Oh,
we are!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mare with a white foot? Her left hind one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s White Foot!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed joyfully.
&ldquo;The stupid creature wandered off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw her making for the valley about five minutes
ago. Like enough she turned in at Silas Malcom&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name took Penny by surprise. Although she
had hoped to find the old man who had visited the
<i>Star</i> office, she had not thought it possible without a
long search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Malcom live near here?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his farm&rsquo;s on down the pike. Want me to
ride along and show you the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the circumstance, Penny and Louise had no
choice but to accept the offer. However, they both
thought that the young man merely was making an
excuse to accompany them. He seemed to read their
minds for he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t actually see your missing horse turn in
at the Malcom place. Know why I think she&rsquo;ll be
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have supernatural powers,&rdquo; Penny
said lightly. &ldquo;From what we hear, this valley is quite
a place for witches and Headless Horsemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man gave her an amused glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The explanation is quite simple,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Silas used to own that horse. All horses have a
strong homing instinct, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that,&rdquo; Louise contributed a bit grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I should introduce myself,&rdquo; the young man
resumed. &ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Joe Quigley. I&rsquo;m the station
agent at Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to meet you,&rdquo; Penny responded.
Though Louise scowled at her, she gave their own
names. She added that they had come to the valley
seeking information about the mysterious Headless
Horseman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of Mr. Burmaster?&rdquo; Quigley inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Penny assured him. &ldquo;We just came for
the fun of it. Is it true that some prankster has been
causing trouble in the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prankster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, someone fixed up to resemble the Headless
Horseman of fable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Quigley grinned broadly. &ldquo;Well, now, you
couldn&rsquo;t prove it by me. Some folks say that on certain
foggy nights the old Galloping Hessian does ride
down out of the hills. But then there are folks who
claim their butter won&rsquo;t churn because it&rsquo;s been bewitched.
I never put much stock in such talk myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve never actually seen such a rider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Quigley remained silent. After a thoughtful
interval he admitted: &ldquo;Well, one night over a month
ago, I did see something strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Louise asked quickly.</p>
<p>Quigley pointed far up the hillside. &ldquo;See that big
boulder? Witching Rock it&rsquo;s called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded. &ldquo;We were there only a few minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night fog rises up from the valley and gives
the place a spooky look. Years ago a tramp was
killed there. No one ever did learn the how or why
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you saw?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t rightly say,&rdquo; Quigley returned soberly. &ldquo;I
was on this same turnpike when I chanced to glance
up toward that big rock. I saw something there in
the mist and then the next minute it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the Headless Horseman?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d have thought
I imagined it only I heard clattering hoofbeats. But
I can tell you one thing about this valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the inhabitants are said to be bewitched!
That&rsquo;s why I act so crazy myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tossed her head. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re just laughing
at us,&rdquo; she accused. &ldquo;I suppose it does sound silly to
say we came here searching for a Headless Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not in the least silly,&rdquo; Quigley corrected.
&ldquo;I might pay you a compliment by saying you impress
me as very courageous young ladies. May I offer a
word of advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t think we care for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I aim to give it anyway.&rdquo; Quigley
grinned down at Penny. &ldquo;You see, I know who you
are. You&rsquo;re Anthony Parker&rsquo;s daughter, and you&rsquo;ve
built up a reputation for solving mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was astonished for she had not mentioned
her father&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind how I knew,&rdquo; said Quigley, forestalling
questions. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my tip. No one ever
will collect Burmaster&rsquo;s reward offer. So don&rsquo;t waste
time and energy trailing a phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say the reward never will be collected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quigley would not answer. With a provoking
shake of his head, he pointed down the pike to an unpainted
cabin and a huge new barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Malcom place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not
mistaken your missing horse is grazing by the gate.
Goodbye and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a friendly, half-mocking salute, he wheeled
his mount. The next instant horse and rider had
crashed through a gap in the roadside brush and were
lost to view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>SLEEPY HOLLOW ESTATE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that young man was having fun at our
expense,&rdquo; Penny remarked after horse and rider had
gone. &ldquo;How do you suppose he knew about my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it in a newspaper probably. You&rsquo;ve both
made the headlines often enough.&rdquo; Louise sighed
wearily and shifted positions. &ldquo;I certainly wish we
never had come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny said with emphasis. She
clucked to Bones and when he failed to move smartly
along, gave him a quick jab with her heels. &ldquo;If Joe
Quigley won&rsquo;t tell us about that galloping ghost,
perhaps Mr. Malcom will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle for my missing horse,&rdquo; Louise responded.</p>
<p>The girls jogged on down the road toward the Malcom
cabin. Already the hills were casting long blue
shadows over the valley floor. With night fast approaching
Penny began to wonder where they could
seek lodging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t catch me staying at the Malcom place,&rdquo;
Louise said, reading her chum&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
ramshackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing nearer the cabin, both girls were elated to
see White Foot grazing contentedly in a stony field
adjoining the Malcom barn yard. At the gate Penny
alighted nimbly and threw it open so that Louise
could ride through.</p>
<p>The creaking of the rusty hinges brought Silas
Malcom from the tumble-down house. He stared
blankly for a moment and then recognized Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bless my heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t the
young lady that helped me at the newspaper office!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s your turn to help us,&rdquo; laughed
Penny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost our horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed somebody would be along for her purty
soon,&rdquo; the old man chuckled. &ldquo;She run into the barn
yard &rsquo;bout ten minutes ago an&rsquo; I turned her out to
graze. I&rsquo;ll git her for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mr. Malcom was surprised to see Penny so far
from Riverview he did not disclose it. He asked no
questions. Hobbling to the fence, he whistled a shrill
blast. White Foot pricked up her ears and then came
trotting over to nuzzle the old man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have that horse under control,&rdquo; said
Penny admiringly. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all in the way you
handle &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also all in the way you handle a Flying Fortress
or a stick of dynamite,&rdquo; Louise cut in. &ldquo;You may
have my share of horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Foot didn&rsquo;t throw you off?&rdquo; Mr. Malcom
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Louise assured him, and explained how
the horse had run away.</p>
<p>Old Silas chuckled appreciatively. &ldquo;White Foot
always did have a habit o&rsquo; sneakin&rsquo; off like that.
Raised her from a colt, but sold her to Williams down
in Hobostein when I got short o&rsquo; cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapping the reins about a hitching post, the old
man allowed his gaze to wander toward the valley.
With a gesture that was hard to interpret, he indicated
the long stretch of fertile pasture land, golden grain
fields and orderly rows of young orchard trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful valley,&rdquo; Louise murmured politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mor&rsquo;n that,&rdquo; corrected the old man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
lookin&rsquo; at one o&rsquo; the richest parcels o&rsquo; land in this here
state. Me and the old woman lived down there fer
goin&rsquo; on twenty years. Then we was put out o&rsquo; our
cabin. Now that penny-pinchin&rsquo; Burmaster owns
every acre fer as you can see&mdash;not countin&rsquo; the
village o&rsquo; Delta an&rsquo; three acres held fer spite by the
Widder Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Old Silas took a chew of tobacco and pointed to
a trim little log cabin visible through a gap in the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stands out like a sore thumb, don&rsquo;t it? Burmaster&rsquo;s
done everything he can to git rid o&rsquo; that
place, but the Widder Lear jes&rsquo; sits tight an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t
have no dealings with him. Says that if the old skinflint
comes round her place again she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to drive
him off with a shotgun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise waited, hoping that the old man
would tell more. After a little silence, he resumed
meditatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Widder was the smartest o&rsquo; the lot of us.
From the first she said Burmaster was out to gobble
up all the best land for hisself. Nobody could get
her to sign no papers. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s got her little
place today and the rest of us is tryin&rsquo; to make a livin&rsquo;
out o&rsquo; these stone patches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burmaster forced all of the valley folk off their
land?&rdquo; Penny inquired, perplexed. &ldquo;How could he
do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em sold out to him,&rdquo; Old Silas admitted.
&ldquo;But mostly the land was owned by a rich feller in
Boston. He never paid no attention to his holdings
&rsquo;cept to collect a bit o&rsquo; rent now and then. But last
spring he up and sold out to Burmaster, and we was
all told to git off the land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Penny nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I suppose that was
entirely legal. If Mr. Burmaster bought and paid for
the land one couldn&rsquo;t accuse him of dishonest
dealings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t accusin&rsquo; nobody o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Old Silas replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jes&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; you how things are in this here
valley. Ye came to find out about that Headless
Horseman, didn&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, we did,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figured you would. You&rsquo;ll never win that reward
Burmaster&rsquo;s offerin&rsquo;, but you could do a heap
o&rsquo; good in this here valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Penny, even more puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a pa that runs a big city newspaper.
When he prints an editorial piece in that paper o&rsquo; his,
folks read it and pay attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will after you been here awhile,&rdquo; the old man
chuckled. &ldquo;Where you gals calculatin&rsquo; to spend the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and the ole woman&rsquo;d be glad to take you in,
only we ain&rsquo;t got no room fitten for city-raised gals.
The Widder Lear&rsquo;ll be glad to give you bed and
fodder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls thanked Mr. Malcom, though secretly
they were sure they would keep on until they reached
Delta. A suspicion was growing in Penny&rsquo;s mind that
she had not come to the valley of her own free will.
Rather she had been lured there by Old Silas&rsquo; Headless
Horseman tale. She had assumed the old fellow
to be a simple, trusting hillman, while in truth he
meant to make use of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Calculate you&rsquo;re anxious-like to git down to the
valley &rsquo;fore night sets on,&rdquo; the old man resumed.
&ldquo;The turnpike&rsquo;s no fitten place for a gal after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we might meet the Headless Horseman?&rdquo;
Penny asked, smiling.</p>
<p>Old Silas deliberately allowed the question to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; follow the turnpike,&rdquo; he instructed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
come fust to the Burmaster place. Then on beyond
is the Widder Lear&rsquo;s cabin. She&rsquo;ll treat you right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had intended to ask Old Silas if he still had
a spinning wheel for sale. However, a glimpse of the
darkening sky warned her there was no time to waste.
She and Louise must hasten on unless they expected
to be overtaken by night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; Penny said, vaulting into the saddle.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably see you again before we leave the
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calculate you will,&rdquo; agreed Old Silas. As he
opened the gate for the girls he smiled in a way they
could not fathom.</p>
<p>Once more on the curving turnpike, Penny and
Louise discussed the old man&rsquo;s strange words. Both
were agreed that Silas had not been in the least surprised
to see them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he say I could do good in the valley?&rdquo;
Penny speculated. &ldquo;Evidently he thinks I&rsquo;ll influence
my father to write something in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against Burmaster perhaps,&rdquo; nodded Louise.
&ldquo;Everyone we&rsquo;ve met seems to dislike that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls clattered over a little log bridge and
rounded a bend. Giant trees arched their limbs over
the pike, creating a dark, cool tunnel. Penny and
Louise urged their tired horses to a faster pace.
Though neither would have admitted it, they had no
desire to be on the turnpike after nightfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Louise commanded suddenly. &ldquo;What
was that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew rein to listen. Only a chirp of a
cricket disturbed the eerie stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for a minute I thought I heard hoofbeats,&rdquo;
Louise said apologetically. &ldquo;Guess I must have imagined
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from the long avenue of trees, the girls
were slightly dismayed to see how swiftly darkness
had spread its cloak on the valley. Beyond the
next turn of the corkscrew road stood a giant tulip
tree. Riding beneath it, Penny stared up at the
gnarled limbs which were twisted in fantastic shapes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an old tulip tree in the Legend of
Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo; she murmured in awe. &ldquo;And it was
close by that the Headless Horseman appeared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please hush?&rdquo; Louise interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
jittery enough without any build-up from you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Some distance ahead stretched a long, narrow
bridge with a high wooden railing. By straining their
eyes the girls could see that it crossed a mill pond and
led in a graceful curve to a rambling manor house of
clapboard and stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burmaster&rsquo;s estate!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it looks exactly as I imagined it would!&rdquo;
Penny added in delight. &ldquo;A perfect setting for the
Galloping Hessian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too spooky if you ask me,&rdquo; said Louise with a
shiver. &ldquo;Why would anyone build an expensive
home in such a lonely place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls rode on. A group of oaks, heavily matted
with wild grapevines, threw a deeper gloom over the
road. For a short distance the dense growth of trees
hid the estate from view.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girls were startled to hear the sharp,
ringing clop-clop of steel-shod hoofs. Unmistakably,
the sound came from the direction of the long, narrow
bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I knew I heard hoofbeats a moment ago!&rdquo;
Louise whispered nervously. &ldquo;Maybe it <i>is</i> the Headless
Horseman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be your age!&rdquo; chided Penny. &ldquo;We both know
there&rsquo;s no such thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words died on her lips. From somewhere in
the darkness ahead came a woman&rsquo;s terrified scream.
Frightened by the sound, Bones gave a startled snort.
With a jerk which nearly flung Penny from the saddle,
he plunged on toward the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>GHOSTS AND WITCHES</i></h2>
<p>His ears laid back, Bones plunged headlong toward
the gloom-shrouded bridge. Pins shook from Penny&rsquo;s
head, and her hair became a stream of gold in the
wind. She hunched low in the saddle, but could not
stop the horse though she pulled hard on the reins.</p>
<p>As she reached a dense growth of elder bushes, a
man leaped out to grasp the bridle. Bones snorted
angrily and pounded the earth with his hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; Penny gasped, and then she
realized that the man had not meant to help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s been causing so much
trouble here!&rdquo; he exclaimed wrathfully. &ldquo;Get down
out of that saddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing!&rdquo; Penny retorted. She tried
to push him away.</p>
<p>Louise came trotting up on White Foot. Her
unexpected arrival seemed to disconcert the man for
he released Bones&rsquo; bridle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he trying to do?&rdquo; Louise demanded
sharply, pulling up beside her chum.</p>
<p>Before Penny could find tongue, another man,
heavily built, came running across the narrow bridge.
His bald head bore no covering and the long tails of
his well-cut coat flapped wildly in the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let that rider get away, Jennings!&rdquo; he cried
accusingly to the workman. &ldquo;Did you see him ride
across the bridge and then take a trail along the creek
bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, Mr. Burmaster,&rdquo; the workman
mumbled. &ldquo;I heard hoof beats and came as fast as I
could from the grist mill. The only rider I saw was
this girl. There&rsquo;s two of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a perfect right to be here,&rdquo; Penny declared.
&ldquo;We were riding along the pike when we
heard hoofbeats, then a scream. My horse became
frightened and plunged down this way toward the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I grabbed the bridle, Miss,&rdquo; the workman
apologized. &ldquo;You see, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trouble, Jennings, is that you never think!&rdquo;
cut in the owner of Sleepy Hollow curtly. &ldquo;You
never even saw the rider who got away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. But I&rsquo;ll get the other workmen and go
after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your efforts. He was only a boy&mdash;not
the man we&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a boy, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scamp clattered a stick against the railing of
the bridge just to frighten my wife. Mrs. Burmaster
is a very nervous woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the workman rather emphatically.
&ldquo;I know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do?&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster asked, his tone unfriendly.
&ldquo;Well, get to the house and tell her there&rsquo;s
no cause to scream to high heaven. The boy, whoever
he was, is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; the workman mumbled, starting
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mind, next time I order you to watch this
road, I mean watch it!&rdquo; the estate owner called after
him. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll find another man to take your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Burmaster turned toward the girls, they
obtained a better view of his face. He wore glasses
and his cheeks were pouchy; a hooked nose curved
down toward a mouth that was hard and firm. Yet
when he spoke it was with a surprisingly pleasant
tone of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for the stupid actions of my
workman,&rdquo; he said to Penny. &ldquo;He should have
known that you were not the one we are after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the Headless Horseman?&rdquo; Penny asked, half
jokingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Mr. Burmaster stepped closer so that he could gaze
up into the girl&rsquo;s face. He scrutinized it for a moment,
and then without answering her question said:
&ldquo;You are a stranger to the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I ask how you knew about our difficulties
here at Sleepy Hollow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny explained that she had seen the estate
owner&rsquo;s advertisement in the <i>Hobostein Weekly</i>.
She did not add that it was the real reason why she and
Louise had made the long trip from Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be willing to pay any amount to be rid of that
so-called ghost who annoys us here at Sleepy
Hollow,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster said bitterly. &ldquo;Night after
night my wife has had no rest. The slightest sound
terrifies her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us more about the mysterious rider,&rdquo; Penny
urged. &ldquo;What time does he appear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no predicting that. Often he rides
over the bridge on stormy or foggy nights. Then
again it&rsquo;s apt to be just after dusk. Tonight we
thought we had the scamp, but it proved to be only a
mischievous boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your workmen stand guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have orders to watch this bridge day and
night. But the men are a lazy lot. They wander off
or they go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible that the disturbance always has
been caused by a boy&mdash;perhaps this lad who clattered
over the bridge tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster snapped impatiently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the Headless Horseman at least five times
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the rider actually has no head?&rdquo; Louise
interposed in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The appearance is that. Of course there&rsquo;s no
question but someone from the village or the hills has
been impersonating Irving&rsquo;s celebrated character of
fiction. The point is, the joke&rsquo;s gone too far!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; Louise murmured sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife and I came to this little valley with only
one thought. We wanted to build a fine home for
ourselves amid peaceful surroundings. We brought
in city workmen, a clever architect. No expense was
spared to make this house and estate perfect. But
when we tried to recreate the atmosphere of Sleepy
Hollow, we didn&rsquo;t anticipate getting a ghost with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the trouble first start?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost from the hour of our arrival. The
country folks didn&rsquo;t like it because we imported city
labor. They hindered our efforts. The women were
abusive to my wife. Then last Halloween, the Headless
Horseman clattered over this bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it have been a holiday prank?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thought so at first, but a month later, the same
thing happened again. This time the scamp tossed a
pebble against our bedroom window. Since then the
rider has been coming at fairly frequent intervals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know it&rsquo;s a prank why should it worry
you?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thing like that wears one down after awhile,&rdquo;
the owner of the estate said wearily. &ldquo;For myself I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind, but my wife&rsquo;s going to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it your wife we heard scream?&rdquo; Louise
asked, seeking to keep the conversational ball rolling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s apt to go off the deep end whenever
anyone rides fast over the bridge. My wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster did not complete what he had intended
to say. At that moment a soft padding of
footsteps was heard, a creaking of boards on the
bridge. From the direction of the house came a tall,
shadowy figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying about me, John?&rdquo; The
voice was that of a woman, shrill and strident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; murmured the estate owner. He
turned toward her. &ldquo;Matilda,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;these
girls are strangers to the Valley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were complaining about me to them!&rdquo; the
woman accused. &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t deny it! I distinctly
heard you! You&rsquo;re always saying things to
hurt my feelings. You don&rsquo;t care how I suffer. Isn&rsquo;t
it enough that I have to live in this horrible community,
among such cruel hateful people without you
turning against me too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Matilda&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Matilda&rsquo; me! Apologize at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly I apologize,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster said
soothingly. &ldquo;I was only telling the girls how nervous
it makes you when anyone rides at a fast pace over the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t I be nervous?&rdquo; the woman
demanded. &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve come to this community,
I&rsquo;ve been subjected to every possible insult! I suppose
you let that rider get away again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was only a mischievous boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who he was!&rdquo; the woman cried. &ldquo;I
want him caught and turned over to the authorities.
I want everyone who rides over this bridge arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a public highway, Matilda. When we
built this footbridge over the brook we had to grant
permission for pedestrians and horseback riders to
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make them change the ruling! Aren&rsquo;t you
the richest man in the Valley? Or doesn&rsquo;t that mean
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster glanced apologetically at Penny and
Louise. The girls, quite taken aback by the woman&rsquo;s
tirade, felt rather sorry for him. It was plain to see
that Mrs. Burmaster was not a well woman. Her
sharp, angular face was drawn as if from constant
worry, and she kept patting nervously at the stiff rolls
of her hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;d better be moving on,&rdquo; Penny
said significantly to Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must,&rdquo; her companion agreed with alacrity.
&ldquo;Mr. Burmaster, is Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s place on down
this road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner of Sleepy Hollow was given no opportunity
to answer. Before he could speak, his wife
stepped closer, glaring up at Louise in the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re friends of Mrs. Lear?&rdquo; she demanded
mockingly. &ldquo;I suppose that old hag sent you here
to snoop and pry and annoy me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, no!&rdquo; gasped Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never even seen the woman,&rdquo; Penny added.
&ldquo;Silas Malcom told us that Mrs. Lear might give us
a room for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Malcom!&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster seized upon the
name. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s another who tries to make trouble for
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in need of a place to stay, we&rsquo;ll be glad
to have you remain with us,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster invited.
&ldquo;We have plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burmaster remained silent, but in the semi-darkness,
the girls saw her give her husband a quick
nudge. No need to be told that they were unwelcome
by the eccentric mistress of Sleepy Hollow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly stay,&rdquo; Penny
said, gathering up the reins.</p>
<p>She and Louise walked their horses single file over
the creaking bridge. Just as they reached the far end
Mr. Burmaster called to them. Pulling up, they
waited for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mind my wife,&rdquo; he said in an undertone.
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t mean half what she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; Penny assured him kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were interested in the Headless
Horseman,&rdquo; the estate owner went on hurriedly.
&ldquo;Well, my offer holds. I&rsquo;ll pay a liberal reward to
anyone who can learn the identity of the prankster.
It&rsquo;s no boy. I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny replied that she and Louise would like to
help if they knew how.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that part later on,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
said. He glanced quickly over his shoulder, observing
that his wife was coming. &ldquo;No chance now.
You&rsquo;ll stay with Mrs. Lear tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll take us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she will, though her place is an eye-sore.
Now this is what you might do. Get the old lady
to talking. If she should give you the slightest hint
who the prankster is, seize upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Mrs. Lear knows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect half the community does!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
answered bitterly. &ldquo;Everyone except ourselves.
We&rsquo;re hated here. No one will cooperate with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thought over the request. She did not like
the idea of going to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s home to spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she answered, without making a
definite promise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burmaster was coming across the bridge. Not
wishing to talk to her, the girls bade the owner of
Sleepy Hollow a hasty farewell and rode away. Once
on the turnpike, they discussed the queer mistress of
the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me, everyone in this community is
queer,&rdquo; Louise grumbled. &ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster just
seems a bit more so than the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intent upon reaching the Lear homestead, the saddle-weary
girls kept on along the winding highway.
It was impossible to make good time for White Foot
kept giving Louise trouble. Presently the mare
stopped dead in her tracks, then wheeled and started
back toward the Burmaster estate. Louise, bouncing
helplessly, shrieked to her chum for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rein her in!&rdquo; Penny shouted.</p>
<p>When Louise seemed unable to obey, Penny rode
Bones alongside and seized the reins. White Foot
then stopped willingly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I ask of life is to get off this creature!&rdquo; Louise
half sobbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired enough to die! And we&rsquo;ve
had nothing to eat since noon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brace up,&rdquo; Penny encouraged her. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
be much farther to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s place. I&rsquo;ll lead your
horse for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the reins again, she led White Foot down
the road at a walk. They met no one on the lonely,
twisting highway. The only sound other than the
steady clop of hoofbeats was an occasional guttural
twang from a bullfrog.</p>
<p>The night grew darker. Louise began to shiver,
though not so much from cold as nervousness. Her
gaze constantly roved along the deep woods to the
left of the road. Seeing something white and ghostly
amid the trees, she called Penny&rsquo;s attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Penny scoffed. &ldquo;Just an old
tree trunk split by lightning. That streak of white
is the inner wood showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bend in the road lay just ahead. Rounding it,
the girls saw what appeared to be a camp fire glowing
in the distance. The wind carried a strong odor of
wood smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Louise asked uneasily. &ldquo;Someone
camping along the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see a house on ahead,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;The
bonfire seems to have been built in the yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls were convinced that they were approaching
the Lear place. The fire, however, puzzled them.
And their wonderment grew as they rode closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>In the glare of the leaping flames they saw a huge,
hanging iron kettle. A dark figure hovered over it,
stirring the contents with a stick.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, Penny&rsquo;s hand tightened on the reins
and Bones stopped. Louise pulled up so short that
White Foot nearly reared back on her hind legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witch!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed, half jubilantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to meet one, and this is our chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>BED AND BOARD</i></h2>
<p>For a moment the two girls watched in awe the
dark, grotesque figure silhouetted against the leaping
flames of the fire. A woman in a long, flowing gown
kept stirring the contents of the iron kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look exactly like a witch!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed
again. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Mrs. Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the Lear place I know one thing!&rdquo; Louise
announced dramatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going straight on to
Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew better than to argue with her chum.
Softly she quoted from &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Double, double, toil and trouble</p>
<p class="t">Fire burn and cauldron bubble.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is all we&rsquo;ve had since we started this wild
trip,&rdquo; Louise broke in. &ldquo;And now you ask me to
spend the night with a witch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud, or the witch may hear you,&rdquo; Penny
cautioned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Lou. It&rsquo;s only a woman
out in her back yard cooking supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a bit late, but so are we. Any port in
a storm. Come along, Louise. I&rsquo;ll venture that whatever
is cooking in that kettle will be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rode on and Louise had no choice but to
follow. A hundred yards farther on they came to an
ancient farmhouse set back from the road. Dismounting,
the girls tied their horses to an old-fashioned
hitching rack near the sagging gate. A mailbox bore
the name: Mrs. M. J. Lear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place all right,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>Just inside the gate stood an ancient domicile that
by daylight was shaded by a giant sycamore. Built
of small bricks, it had latticed windows, and a gabled
front. An iron weathercock perched on the curling
shingle roof seemed to gaze saucily down at the girls.</p>
<p>Going around the house to the back yard, Penny
and Louise again came within view of the blazing fire.
An old woman in a long black dress bent over the
smoke-blackened kettle which hung from the iron
crane. Hearing footsteps, she glanced up alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she called, and the crackled voice was
sharp rather than friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Malcom sent us here,&rdquo; Penny said, moving
into the arc of flickering light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And who be you? Friends o&rsquo; his?&rdquo; The hatchet-faced
woman peered intently, almost suspiciously at
the two girls.</p>
<p>Penny gave her name and Louise&rsquo;s, adding that they
were seeking lodging for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay, of course,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>The old woman scrutinized the girls for so long
that they were certain she would send them away.
But when she spoke, her voice was friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she cackled, &ldquo;anybody that&rsquo;s a friend
of Silas is a friend of mine. You&rsquo;re welcome to bed
and board fer as long as you want to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thanked her and stepped closer to the kettle.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not had anything to eat since noon,&rdquo; she said
suggestively. &ldquo;My, whatever you&rsquo;re cooking looks
good!&rdquo; She sniffed at the steam arising from the iron
pot and backed hastily away.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Lear broke into cackling laughter. &ldquo;You
gals don&rsquo;t want none o&rsquo; that! This here is soap and
I&rsquo;m head over heels in it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m workin&rsquo; so
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soap,&rdquo; repeated Penny with deep respect. &ldquo;Why,
I thought soap was made in a factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear was pleased at the girl&rsquo;s interest. &ldquo;Most
of it is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but not my soap. This here is
homemade soap and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade a cake of it for
all the store soap ye can lug home&mdash;not for heavy
cleanin&rsquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Moving near enough to the fire to see the greasy
mixture bubbling in the kettle, Penny asked Mrs. Lear
if she would explain how soap was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, yes,&rdquo; the old lady replied with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;You are the first gal I ever ran across that
was interested in anything as old fashioned as soap
makin&rsquo;. Why, when I was young every girl knew
how to make soap and was proud of it. But nowdays!
All the girls think about is gaddin&rsquo; and dancin&rsquo; and
having dates with some worthless good-for-nothin&rsquo;.
Come right up to the fire and I&rsquo;ll show you something
about soap makin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear poked the glowing logs beneath the
kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;is to get your fire
good and hot. Then you add your scrap grease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is scrap grease?&rdquo; Louise asked, greatly intrigued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless you, child, that&rsquo;s the odds and ends
of cookin&rsquo; that most folks throw away. Not me
though. I make soap of it. Even if it ain&rsquo;t so good
smellin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s better soap than you can buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked over the rim of the steaming kettle
and saw a quantity of bubbling fats. With surprising
dexterity for one of her age, Mrs. Lear inserted a long-handled
hoe-shaped paddle and stirred the mixture
vigorously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing ye do is to cook in the lye,&rdquo; she instructed.
&ldquo;Then you let it cool off and slice it to
any size you want. This mess&rsquo;ll soon be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all there is to making soap,&rdquo; Penny said,
a bit amazed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but a little elbow grease and some git up and
git!&rdquo; the old lady chuckled. &ldquo;Them two commodities
are mighty scarce these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girls watched, Mrs. Lear poured off the
soap mixture. She would not allow them to help lest
they burn themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kin tell that you girls are all tuckered out,&rdquo; she
said when the task was finished. &ldquo;Just put your
horses in the barn and toss &rsquo;em some corn and hay.
While you&rsquo;re gone I&rsquo;ll clean up these soap makin&rsquo;
things and start a mess o&rsquo; victuals cookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear waved a bony hand toward a large, unpainted
outbuilding. Louise and Penny led their
horses to it, opening the creaking old barn door somewhat
cautiously. A sound they could not instantly
identify greeted their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Louise whispered, holding back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a horse gnawing corn!&rdquo; Penny chuckled.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lear must keep a steed of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dark in the barn even with the doors left
wide open. Groping their way to empty stalls, the
girls unsaddled and tied the horses up for the night.
Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s animal, they noted, was a high-spirited animal,
evidently a thoroughbred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A riding horse too,&rdquo; Penny remarked. &ldquo;Wonder
how she can afford to keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding corn in the bin, the girls fed Bones and
White Foot, and forked them an ample supply of hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to feed ourselves,&rdquo; Penny sighed as they left
the barn. &ldquo;My stomach feels as empty as the Grand
Canyon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had visions of a bountiful supper cooked
over the camp fire. However, Mrs. Lear was putting
out the glowing coals with a bucket of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take
me long to git a meal knocked up. That is, if you
ain&rsquo;t too particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything suits us,&rdquo; Louise assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the more of it, the better,&rdquo; Penny muttered,
though under her breath.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear led the way to the house, advising the
girls to wait at the door until she could light a kerosene
lamp. By its ruddy glow they saw a kitchen,
very meagerly furnished with old-fashioned cook
stove, a homemade table and a few chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re washin&rsquo; up I&rsquo;ll put on some victuals
to cook,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said, showing the girls a wash
basin and pitcher. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take me a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a speed that was amazing, the old lady lighted
the cook stove and soon had a bed of glowing coals.
She warmed up a pan of potatoes, fried salt pork and
hominy. From a pantry shelf she brought wild grape
jelly and a loaf of homemade bread. To complete
the meal she set before the girls a pitcher of milk and
a great glass dish brimming with canned peaches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; she apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food never looked better,&rdquo; Penny declared, drawing
a chair to the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvelous supper!&rdquo; Louise added, her eyes
fairly caressing the food.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear sat down at the table with the girls and
seemed to take keen delight in watching them eat.
Whenever their appetites lagged for an instant she
would pass them another dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve et, tell me who you are and
why you came,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear urged after the girls had
finished. &ldquo;You say Silas sent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good food had stimulated Penny and Louise and
made them in a talkative mood. They told of their
long trip from Riverview and almost before they
realized it, had spoken of the Headless Horseman.
Mrs. Lear listened attentively, her watery blue eyes
dancing with interest. Suddenly Penny cut her story
short, conscious that the old lady deliberately was
pumping her of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d like to collect Mr. Burmaster&rsquo;s reward?&rdquo;
Mrs. Lear chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;Besides,
we&rsquo;d be doing the Burmasters a good turn to help
them get rid of their ghost rider.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That you would,&rdquo; agreed the old lady exactly as
if the Burmasters were her best friends. &ldquo;Yes, indeed,
you&rsquo;ve come in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you can help us,&rdquo; Louise said
eagerly. &ldquo;You must have heard about the Headless
Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear nodded brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you know who the person is,&rdquo; Penny
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe not.&rdquo; Mrs. Lear shrugged, and
getting quickly up, began to carry the dishes to the
sink. The firm tilt of her thin chin warned the girls
that so far as she was concerned, the topic was closed.</p>
<p>Rather baffled, Penny and Louise made a feeble
attempt to reopen the conversation. Failing, they
offered to wipe the dishes for their hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t no bother to do &rsquo;em myself,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lear said, shooing them away. &ldquo;You both look tired
enough to drop. Just go up to the spare bedroom and
slip beneath the covers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise and Penny needed no further urging. Carrying
their knapsacks and a lamp Mrs. Lear gave
them, they stumbled up the stairs. The spare bedroom
was a huge, rather cold chamber, furnished with
a giant fourposter bed and a chest of drawers. The
only floor covering was a homemade rag rug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Louise quickly undressed and left Penny to blow
out the light. The latter, moving to the latticed window,
stood for a moment gazing out across the moonlit
fields toward the Burmaster estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing makes sense about this trip,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>From the bed came a muffled: &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the jibe, Penny resumed: &ldquo;Did you notice
how Mrs. Lear acted just as if the Burmasters were
her friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she did that to throw us off the track. She
asked us plenty of questions but she didn&rsquo;t tell us
one thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet she knows plenty. I&rsquo;m convinced of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on to bed,&rdquo; Louise pleaded, yawning.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do your speculating in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh, Penny leaped into the very center of
the feather bed, missing her chum&rsquo;s anatomy by
inches.</p>
<p>Soon Mrs. Lear came upstairs. She tapped softly
on the door and inquired if the girls had plenty of
covers. Assured that they were comfortable, she
went on down the hall to her own room.</p>
<p>Worn from the long horseback ride, Louise fell
asleep almost at once. Penny felt too excited to be
drowsy. She lay staring up at the ceiling, reflecting
upon the day&rsquo;s events. So far, the journey to the
Valley had netted little more than sore muscles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet there&rsquo;s mystery and intrigue here&mdash;I know
it!&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;If only I could get a little
tangible information!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour elapsed and still the girl could not sleep.
As she stirred restlessly, she heard Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s bedroom
door softly creak. In the hallway boards began
to tremble. Penny stiffened, listening. Distinctly,
she could hear someone tiptoeing past her door to the
stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Mrs. Lear,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But what
can she be doing up at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question did not long remain unanswered.
Boards squeaked steadily as the old lady descended the
stairs. A little silence. Then Penny heard two long
rings and a short one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear is calling someone on the old-fashioned
party-line telephone!&rdquo; she identified the sound.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s squeaky voice carried clearly up the
stairway through the half open bedroom door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Silas?&rdquo; Penny heard her say. &ldquo;Well,
those gals got here, just as you said they would! First
off they asked me about the Headless Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight pause followed before Mrs. Lear added:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none, Silas. Just count on me!
They&rsquo;ll handle soft as kittens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as she ended the telephone conversation, the
old lady broke into cackling laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>A RICH MAN&rsquo;S TROUBLES</i></h2>
<p>Rain was drumming on the roof when Penny
awakened the next morning. Yawning sleepily, she
sat up in bed. Beside her, Louise, curled into a tight
ball, slumbered undisturbed. But not for long. Penny
tickled an exposed foot until she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Lou!&rdquo; she ordered pleasantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
overslept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s still night,&rdquo; Louise grumbled, trying to
snuggle beneath the covers again.</p>
<p>Penny stripped off all the blankets and pulled her
chum from the bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only so dark because it&rsquo;s
raining,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Anyway, I have something
important to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls dressed in the cold bedroom, Penny
told Louise of the telephone conversation she had
heard the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear was talking to Silas Malcom I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
she concluded. &ldquo;And about us too! She said we&rsquo;d
handle very easily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s eyes opened a trifle wider. &ldquo;Then you
figure Silas Malcom intended to get us here on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; Penny said with a shrug. &ldquo;These
Valley folk aren&rsquo;t simple by any means! Unless we
watch our step they may take us for a merry
ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with the Headless Horseman, I hope,&rdquo; Louise
chuckled. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go home this morning and
forget the whole silly affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sticking until I find
out what&rsquo;s going on here,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;It might
mean a story for Dad&rsquo;s paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only your excuse,&rdquo; Louise teased. &ldquo;You
know you never could resist a mystery, and this one
certainly has baffling angles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls washed in a basin of cold water and then
went downstairs. Mrs. Lear was baking pancakes
in the warm kitchen. She flipped one neatly as she
reached with the other hand to remove the coffee pot
from the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she chirped. &ldquo;Did you sleep
right last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise agreed that they had and edged
close to the stove for warmth. An old-fashioned
clock on the mantel showed that it was only eight
o&rsquo;clock. But eight o&rsquo;clock for Mrs. Lear was a late
hour, judging by the amount of work she had done.
A row of glass jars stood on the table, filled with
canned plums and peaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t put up all that fruit this morning?&rdquo;
gasped Louise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear admitted that she had. &ldquo;But that ain&rsquo;t
much,&rdquo; she added modestly. &ldquo;Only a bushel and a
half. Won&rsquo;t hardly last no time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear cleared off the kitchen table, set it in a
twinkling, and placed before the girls a huge mound
of stacked cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now eat hearty,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;I had mine hours
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny ate, she sought to draw a little information
from the eccentric old woman. Deliberately,
she brought up the subject of the Burmaster family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want to know?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear asked,
smiling wisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is Mrs. Burmaster so disliked in the community?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s a scheming, trouble maker if there
ever was one!&rdquo; the old lady replied promptly. &ldquo;Mr.
Burmaster ain&rsquo;t so bad, only he&rsquo;s pulled around by
the nose by that weepin&rsquo;, whinin&rsquo; wife of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster seems to think that the valley folk
treat her cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She should talk about being cruel!&rdquo; Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s
dark eyes flashed. &ldquo;You know what them Burmasters
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in a general way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they come here, and forced folks to git off
the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mr. Burmaster pay for what he bought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was done legal,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear admitted grudgingly.
&ldquo;You see, most o&rsquo; this valley was owned by
a man in the East. He rented it out in parcels, an&rsquo;
never bothered anyone even if they was behind in
their payments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Burmaster bought the entire track of
land from the Eastern owner?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. All except these here four acres
where my house sets. They ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in this world
that will git me in a mood to sell to that old skinflint.
He&rsquo;s tried every trick in the bag already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thoughtfully reached for another pancake.
As an impartial judge she could see that there was
something to be said on both sides of the question.
Mr. Burmaster had purchased his land legally, and
so could not be blamed for asking the former renters
to move. Yet she sympathized with the farmers who
for so many years had considered the valley their
own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This house o&rsquo; mine ain&rsquo;t much to look at,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lear commented reflectively, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s been home fer
a long time. Ain&rsquo;t nobody going to get me out o&rsquo;
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You own your own land?&rdquo; inquired Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Lear proudly. &ldquo;I got
the deed hid under my bed mattress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell us about Mr. Burmaster&rsquo;s difficulty
with the Headless Horseman,&rdquo; Penny urged, feeling
that the old lady was in a talkative mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear asked
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there really such a thing or is it just a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you girls stay in this valley long enough you&rsquo;ll
learn fer yourselves,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant
you&rsquo;ll see that Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know who the prankster is!&rdquo; Penny ventured
daringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear admitted with a chuckle.
&ldquo;But a ten-mule team couldn&rsquo;t pry it out o&rsquo; me, and
neither can you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could resume the subject, chickens
began to squawk and scatter in the barn yard. A
large, expensive looking car pulled up near the side
door. Mrs. Lear peeped out of a window and her jaw
set in a firm, hard line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Burmaster now,&rdquo; she announced in a
stage whisper. &ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to pressure me.
No sir! I&rsquo;ll give him as good as he sends!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>After Mr. Burmaster pounded on the kitchen door,
the old lady took her time before she let him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! What&rsquo;s good about it?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear shot
back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rainin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t it? And if we git much more
o&rsquo; it this fall, the dam up Huntley way&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to let
go shore as I&rsquo;m a standin&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; replied the estate owner impatiently.
He stepped into the kitchen. Seeing Penny and
Louise, he looked rather surprised and a trifle embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and say what you come to say,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear
encouraged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand on no ceremony jus&rsquo; cause
I got city visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously Mr. Burmaster did not like to speak
before strangers, but there was no other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why I am here, Mrs. Lear,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made several offers for your property&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve turned &rsquo;em all down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but this time I hope you&rsquo;ll listen to reason.
Last night my wife had a near collapse after a boy
rode a horse across the bridge by our house. All this
stupid talk about Headless Horsemen has inspired the
community to do mischief. Now every boy in the
Valley is trying pranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not ketch the Horseman and put an
end to it?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear asked impudently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would please me better. But we&rsquo;ve had
no success. My wife can&rsquo;t endure the strain much
longer. It&rsquo;s driving her to a frenzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lear stonily.
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to sell this property,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
pleaded. &ldquo;At least that will remove one irritation.
You see, my wife considers the place an eyesore. She
can see your house from our living room window. It
ruins an otherwise perfect view of the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ain&rsquo;t that too bad!&rdquo; Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s tone was
sarcastic. &ldquo;Well, let me tell you somethin&rsquo;. That
place o&rsquo; yorn spoils my view too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t made myself clear,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
said hastily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of my wife&rsquo;s
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife ain&rsquo;t no more ailin&rsquo; than I be,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lear retorted. &ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t have my house to bother
her it would be somethin&rsquo; else. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to sell
and that&rsquo;s all there is to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not heard my offer. I&rsquo;ll give you two
thousand dollars for this place&mdash;cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear looked a trifle stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At best the place isn&rsquo;t worth five hundred,&rdquo; Mr.
Burmaster resumed. &ldquo;But I aim to be generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said firmly. &ldquo;Not at any
price. Them&rsquo;s my final words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster had kept his voice carefully controlled
but the old lady&rsquo;s decision angered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret this!&rdquo; he said in a harsh tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been very patient but I warn you! From now on I
shall act in my own interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever acted in any other?&rdquo; drawled a
voice from behind the estate owner.</p>
<p>Everyone turned quickly. Joe Quigley, the young
station agent, stood framed in the open doorway.
Smiling at Burmaster in a grim way, he came slowly
into the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER</i></h2>
<p>A silence had fallen upon those in the room. Joe
Quigley shook rain drops from his overcoat. Deliberately
he took his time hanging the coat over a chair
in front of the cook stove. Then, still smiling in an
ironic way, he faced Burmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; he challenged, &ldquo;did you ever act in any
manner except for your own interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are insulting! Insolent!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
snapped. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not be drawn into an argument
with you. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quigley blocked the door. &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; he
drawled. &ldquo;Matter of fact, I was on my way to your
house. Saw your car standing in Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s yard,
so I figured you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a telegram for me I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only message I have is a verbal one,&rdquo; answered
Quigley. &ldquo;Our mayor from Delta, Bradley
Mason, asked me to talk to you about the Huntley
Dam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The subject doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should interest every man, woman and child in
this valley!&rdquo; Quigley retorted. &ldquo;If the dam gives
way flood waters will sweep straight down the valley.
Your house would be destroyed before you knew
there was any danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster&rsquo;s smile was a sneer. &ldquo;Let
me worry about my own property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of record, I don&rsquo;t lose any sleep over
you,&rdquo; Quigley responded heatedly. &ldquo;But I am thinking
about Mrs. Lear and the people living in Delta.
Not to mention the towns on down the line which
would be in the direct path of the flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the good people of Delta are endangered why
don&rsquo;t they repair the dam themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the reason that we can&rsquo;t raise the money.
We&rsquo;ve tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the State should act in the matter. I&rsquo;m willing
to write my senator&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repairs are needed now, not three months later.
Mr. Burmaster, you have the money and you&rsquo;d be
doing the community a great service to lend help.
We&rsquo;re not asking for a donation. It&rsquo;s as much to your
interest as ours to protect the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; Burmaster said angrily. &ldquo;Not
a particle. It&rsquo;s only a scheme to shake me down for
money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Brushing past the station agent, the man went out
into the rain. In driving out of the yard he turned
the car so sharply that it skidded on its wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Quigley remarked with a shrug.
&ldquo;I should have saved my breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad <i>he&rsquo;s</i> gone,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear announced tartly.
&ldquo;Will you have a bite o&rsquo; breakfast, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; the young station agent replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m due for my trick at the Depot in twenty minutes.
Have to run along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were sorry to see Joe Quigley go so soon
for they had hoped to have a long talk with him.
After he had disappeared into the rain they tried without
much success to draw more information from
Mrs. Lear. The old lady was in no mood to discuss
the Burmasters, but she did have a great deal to say
about flood danger to the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t usual that we have so much rain,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Not at this time o&rsquo; year. Old Red River&rsquo;s
floodin&rsquo; to the brim, an keeps pourin&rsquo; more and more
into the Huntley Lake basin. The dam there was
built years ago and it wasn&rsquo;t much to brag on from
the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t authorities inspected the dam recently?&rdquo;
Penny inquired thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some young whippersnapper come here a
month ago and took a quick look and said the dam
would hold,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear replied, tossing her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; in the Valley. We want repairs
made and we want &rsquo;em quick&mdash;not next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Mr. Burmaster refuses to help is there nothing
that can be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some as thinks a little piece in the city
papers might help,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said, giving Penny a
quick, shrewd glance. &ldquo;Your pa&rsquo;s a newspaper owner,
ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he owns the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed across the table at Louise. It struck
both girls that Mrs. Lear was very well informed
about their affairs. How had the old lady learned
that Mr. Parker was a newspaper man if not from
Silas Malcom? More than ever Penny was convinced
that she had been lured to Red Valley, perhaps for
the purpose of interesting her famous father in the
Huntley Dam project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very kind, Mrs. Lear,&rdquo; she said, abruptly
arising from the table. &ldquo;Louise and I appreciate
your hospitality. However, we want to pay for
our room and meals before we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me a penny,&rdquo; the old lady laughed.
&ldquo;Furthermore, you ain&rsquo;t leavin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must. There&rsquo;s an afternoon train&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;ll be another along tomorrow. Why,
you&rsquo;d catch your death o&rsquo; cold ridin&rsquo; hoss back all the
way to Hobostein.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rain should let up soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should, but it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear declared.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay until tomorror anyhow? Then
you could go to the barn dance tonight at Silas&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, the girls were not greatly intrigued
at the prospect of attending a barn dance. The steady
rain had depressed them. Though the long journey
to Red Valley had proven interesting, it scarcely
seemed worth the exhausting effort. They had
learned very little about the so-called Headless Horseman
and doubted that any truly valuable information
would come their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you stay over maybe you&rsquo;ll git a chance to see
that hoss-ridin&rsquo; ghost,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said slyly. &ldquo;Seems
like it&rsquo;s mostly on bad nights that he does his
prowlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls helped with the dishes. They made the bed
and watched Mrs. Lear sew on a rag rug. At intervals
they wandered to the windows. Rain fell
steadily, showing not the slightest sign of a let up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said gleefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
settlin&rsquo; for a good healthy pour. You might jest as
well calculate on stayin&rsquo; another night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our parents will be expecting us home,&rdquo;
Louise protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send &rsquo;em a wire from Delta,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear urged.
&ldquo;Reckon this rain&rsquo;ll maybe slacken a bit come afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Throughout the long morning Louise and Penny
wandered restlessly about the house. Now and then
they sought without success to draw information
from Mrs. Lear about the mysterious prankster. From
the merry twinkle in her eyes they were convinced
she knew a great deal. Pry it from her they could
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that Headless Horseman ain&rsquo;t nobody human,&rdquo;
she chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a real haunt. I mind
the time somebody witched my cow. The stubborn
critter didn&rsquo;t give no milk for eight days steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise weren&rsquo;t sure whether the old lady
was serious or trying to tease them. After awhile they
gave up attempting to solve such an enigma. By noon
they had reconciled themselves to staying another
night at Red Valley. However, scarcely had they
made their decision to remain, than the sky cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck here anyway,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;We
couldn&rsquo;t possibly ride our horses back to Hobostein
in time to catch the afternoon train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After luncheon the girls hiked across-fields to the
picturesque little town of Delta. There they dropped
in at the depot to chat with Joe Quigley and send a
telegram to their parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If time&rsquo;s heavy on your hands why not take a
little jaunt to the Huntley Dam?&rdquo; the station agent
suggested. &ldquo;It should be well worth your time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise decided to do just that. At Mrs.
Lear&rsquo;s once more, they saddled their horses and took
the pike road to a well-marked trail which led up into
the hills. Ditches were brimming with fast running
water, yet there was no other evidence of flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose all this talk about the dam being
weak is just talk?&rdquo; Penny speculated as they rode
along. &ldquo;In case of real danger one would think State
authorities would step into the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the girls came to the winding Red River.
Swollen by the fall rains, the current raced madly over
rocks and stones. The roar of rushing water warned
them that they were close to the dam. In another
moment they glimpsed a mighty torrent of water
pouring in a silvery white ribbon over the high barrier.</p>
<p>Men could be seen working doggedly as they piled
sandbag upon sandbag to strengthen the weakened
structure.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny noticed a man and woman who
wore raincoats, watching the workmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, there&rsquo;s Mr. and Mrs. Burmaster!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>They drove closer to the dam. Mr. and Mrs. Burmaster
were talking so earnestly together that they
did not observe the newcomers. The roar of water
drowned the sound of hoofbeats. But the wind blew
directly toward the girls. Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s voice,
shrill and angrily, came to them clearly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, John! I won&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo; she admonished
her husband. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to give the people
of this valley one penny! The dam is perfectly
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the far side
of the structure.</p>
<p>As he spoke a tiny portion of the dam seemed to
melt away. The girls, watching tensely, saw several
sandbags swept over the brink. Workmen raced to
repair the damage. Mrs. Burmaster seemed stunned
by the sight, but only for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Not a penny of our
money goes into this dam! It will hold. Anyway,
I&rsquo;d rather drown than be bested by that hateful old
lady Lear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Matilda&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me of it again! Get her out of this
Valley&mdash;tear down her shack! If you don&rsquo;t, I warn
you, I&rsquo;ll take matters into my own hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning abruptly, Mrs. Burmaster walked angrily
down the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>

<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>BARN DANCE</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Burmaster was too distracted to pay heed
to Penny and Louise. Brushing past them, he hastened
after his wife.</p>
<p>Neither of the girls commented upon the conversation
they had overheard. For a long while they
sat on their horses, gazing in awe at the tumbling
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever that dam should let go&mdash;&rdquo; Penny shuddered,
&ldquo;why, the valley would be flooded in just a
few minutes. I doubt folks could be warned in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if it could give way any second too,&rdquo;
Louise added uneasily. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get out of
this valley and stay away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And forget the mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of good a mystery would do us if that dam
lets go! Penny, we were crazy to come here in the
first place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to get a big story for Dad&rsquo;s paper.
There&rsquo;s one here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know not what course others may take,&rdquo; Louise
quoted grandly. &ldquo;As for myself, I&rsquo;m going home on
tomorrow&rsquo;s train&mdash;rain or shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both have to go,&rdquo; Penny agreed in a discouraged
tone. &ldquo;I had my chance here, but somehow
I&rsquo;ve muffed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a half hour longer the girls remained at the dam
watching the workmen. Presently returning to the
Lear cottage they found Mrs. Lear in the warm
kitchen, cooking supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m settin&rsquo; the victuals on early tonight,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got any too much time to git to
the frolic at Silas&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise were not sure that they cared to
attend the barn dance. Mrs. Lear, however, was deaf
to all excuses. She whisked supper onto the table and
the instant dishes were done, said that she would hitch
Trinidad to the buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us long to git there,&rdquo; she encouraged
the girls as they reluctantly followed her to the barn.
&ldquo;Trinidad&rsquo;s a fast steppin&rsquo; critter. Best horse in the
county fer that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the ancient buggy was rattling at a brisk clip
along the winding woodland road. Mrs. Lear allowed
Trinidad to slacken pace as they neared the
Burmaster estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that house!&rdquo; she chortled, waving her
buggy whip. &ldquo;Every light in the place lit up! Know
why? Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s afeared o&rsquo; her shadder. Come
dark and she&rsquo;s skeared to stick her nose out the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be afraid of anything,&rdquo; Penny
remarked in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me afeared?&rdquo; the old lady laughed gleefully.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be skeared of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;perhaps a certain Headless Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear hooted. &ldquo;If I was to see that critter
a-comin&rsquo; right now and he had twenty heads, I
wouldn&rsquo;t even bat an eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horse and buggy approached the giant tulip tree
whose gnarled branches were twisted into fantastic
shapes. &ldquo;See that tree?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear demanded. &ldquo;In
Revolutionary days a traitor was hanged from that
lower limb. Sometimes you kin still hear his spirit
sighin&rsquo; and moanin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the wind whistling through the tree
limbs,&rdquo; Penny supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t sound like wind to me,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear corrected
with a grin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;s afeared to
pass under this tree come night&mdash;but not me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buggy rattled on, its top brushing against the
overhanging branches of the giant tulip. It had
grown very dark and the shadows of the woods had
a depressing effect upon the girls. They were glad
to see the lights of the Malcom place on the hill and
even more pleased to drive into the yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You gals go right on in,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear advised, leaping
lightly from the buggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Trinidad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barn dance already was in progress. Crossing
the yard, the girls could hear gay laughter above the
lively squeak of fiddles. Through the open barn door
they glimpsed a throng of young people whirling in
the intricate steps of a square dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certain to be wall flowers at a party such
as this,&rdquo; Louise remarked sadly.</p>
<p>The girls found themselves a quiet corner from
which to watch the merrymakers. However, they
were not permitted to remain there. At the end of
the first dance, Joe Quigley came to ask Penny for
a dance. To Louise&rsquo;s secret joy he brought along a
young man who promptly invited her to be his
partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know how to square dance,&rdquo; Penny
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t take you long to learn,&rdquo; Joe chuckled,
pulling her to her feet.</p>
<p>The fiddler broke into a lively tune. Silas Malcom,
acting as caller, shouted boisterous directions to the
dancers: &ldquo;Balance all, balance eight, swing &rsquo;em like
a-swingin&rsquo; on a gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Quigley, expert dancer that he was, fairly swept
Penny through the intricate formations. Before she
hardly was aware of it, the dance was over and Silas
called out: &ldquo;Meet your partner and promenade home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>After that the girls did not lack for partners. The
night sped on magic wings. Penny danced many
times with Joe and ate supper with him. Then, noticing
that the party was starting to break up, she looked
about for Mrs. Lear. The old lady was nowhere to
be seen. Nor could Louise recall having seen her for
the past half hour. Somewhat disturbed, they crossed
the room to talk to old Silas Malcom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear went home a good hour ago,&rdquo; he told
them. &ldquo;She said she had to git some sleep, but you
gals was havin&rsquo; so much fun she didn&rsquo;t have the heart
to take you away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise could not hide their consternation.
With Mrs. Lear gone they would have no way
of getting back to the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none,&rdquo; Old Silas chuckled. &ldquo;Joe
Quigley will take you home. An&rsquo; if he don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s
plenty o&rsquo; young bucks waitin&rsquo; fer the chanst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement was not in the least to the girls&rsquo;
liking. The party, they could see, rapidly was breaking
up. Joe Quigley seemed to have disappeared.
Nearly all of the girls except themselves were supplied
with escorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this&mdash;not by a little bit!&rdquo; Penny muttered.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we get back to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Without an escort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pass the Burmaster place and that
horrid tulip tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of a tulip tree?&rdquo; Penny laughed.
&ldquo;Come on, if we don&rsquo;t get away quickly Old Silas will
ask some young man to take us home. That would be
humiliating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise reluctantly followed her chum. The girls
obtained their wraps and without attracting attention,
slipped out a side door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose Mrs. Lear slipped off without
saying a word?&rdquo; Louise complained as she and
Penny walked rapidly along the dark, muddy road.
&ldquo;Our shoes will be ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is my ego!&rdquo; Penny added irritably. &ldquo;Joe Quigley
certainly let us down too. He was attentive
enough until after supper. Then he simply vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was very dark for driving clouds had
blotted out the stars. Overhanging trees cast a cavernous
gloom upon the twisting hillside road. Louise
caught herself shivering. Sternly she told herself that
it came from the cold air rather than nervousness.</p>
<p>Presently the girls approached the Burmaster estate.
No lights were burning, but the rambling building
loomed up white and ghost-like through the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll breathe natural when we&rsquo;re across the bridge,&rdquo;
Penny admitted with a laugh. &ldquo;If Mr. Burmaster
keeps a guard hidden in the bushes, the fellow might
heave a rock at us on general principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no sign of anyone near the estate. Yet
both Penny and Louise sensed that they were being
watched. The unpleasant sensation of uneasiness increased
as they drew nearer the foot bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; Louise suddenly admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; Penny asked with forced cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-whispered words died on Louise&rsquo;s lips.
Unexpectedly, the stillness of the night was broken
by the clatter of hoofbeats.</p>
<p>Startled, the girls whirled around. A horse with
a rider had plunged through the dense bushes only a
short distance behind them. At a hard run he came
straight toward the foot bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost rider!&rdquo; Louise whispered in terror.</p>
<p>She and Penny stood frozen in their tracks. Plainly
they could see the white-robed figure. His lumpy,
misshapen hulk, seemed rigidly fastened to the horse.
Where his head should have been there was only a
stub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN</i></h2>
<p>Swift as the wind, the headless horseman approached
the narrow bridge. Penny seized Louise&rsquo;s
hand, jerking her off the road. The ghost rider thundered
past them onto the bridge planks which resounded
beneath the steel-shod hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers creepers!&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
no boy prankster this time! It&rsquo;s the real thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thunder of hoofbeats had not gone unheard
by those within the walls of Sleepy Hollow. Lights
flashed on in the house. Two men with lanterns came
running from the mill shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him! Get him!&rdquo; screamed a woman&rsquo;s voice
from an upstairs window of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The clamor did not seem to disturb the goblin rider.
At unchanged pace he clattered across the bridge to
its far side. As the two men ran toward him, he suddenly
swerved, plunging his horse across a ditch and
up a steep bank. There he drew rein for an instant.
Rising in his stirrups, he hurled a small, hard object
at the two guards. It missed them by inches and fell
with a thud on the bridge. Then with a laugh that
resembled no earthly sound, the Headless Horseman
rode through a gap in the bushes and was gone.</p>
<p>Louise and Penny ran to the bridge. Half way
across they found the object that had been hurled.
It was a small, round stone to which had been fastened
a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Penny picked up the missile. Before she could examine
it, Mr. Burmaster came running from the house.
He had not taken time to dress, but had thrown a
bathrobe over his pajamas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let that fellow get away again!&rdquo; he shouted
angrily to the two workmen. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you ever stay
on the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Mr. Burmaster,&rdquo; one of the men replied.
&ldquo;We work eight hours a day and then do guard duty
at night. You can&rsquo;t expect us to stay awake twenty-four
hours a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster retorted irritably.
Turning toward the bridge he saw Louise and
Penny. &ldquo;Well, so you&rsquo;re here again?&rdquo; he observed,
though not in an unfriendly tone.</p>
<p>Penny explained that she and Louise had attended
the barn dance and were on their way to the Lear
cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you have in your hand?&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone that the Headless Horseman threw at your
workmen. There&rsquo;s a paper tied to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster commanded.</p>
<p>Penny handed over the stone though she would
have preferred to have examined it herself. Mr. Burmaster
cut the string which kept the paper in place.
He held it beneath one of the lanterns.</p>
<p>Large capital letters cut from newspaper headlines
had been pasted in an uneven row across the page.
The words spelled a message which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;KICK IN HANDSOMELY ON THE HUNTLEY
DAM FUND. IF YOU OBLIGE, THE
GALLOPING GHOST WILL BOTHER YOU
NO MORE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster read the message aloud and crumpling
the paper, stuffed it into the pocket of his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see!&rdquo; he cried angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a plot
to force me to put up money for the Huntley Dam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think the prankster is?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster stormed.
&ldquo;The townspeople of Delta may be behind the
scheme. Or those hill rats like Silas Malcom! Then
it could be Old Lady Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she ride a horse?&rdquo; Louise interposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can that old witch ride?&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster snorted.
&ldquo;She was born in a saddle. Has one of the best horses
in the valley too. A jumper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise thought of Trinidad with new
respect. Not without misgiving they recalled that
Mrs. Lear had slipped away from the barn dance
ahead of them. Wisely they kept the knowledge to
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give a thousand dollars for the capture of that
rascal!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster went on. &ldquo;And if it proves
to be Mrs. Lear I&rsquo;ll add another five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not be rid of the Ghost in an easier way?&rdquo;
Penny suggested. &ldquo;Give the money to the Huntley
Dam Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! I&rsquo;ll not be blackmailed! Besides, the
rains are letting up. There&rsquo;s no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise did not attempt to argue the
matter. The Huntley Dam feud was none of their
concern. By the following day they expected to be
far from the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another person who might be behind
this,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster continued. &ldquo;A newspaper editor
at Hobostein. He always hated me and he&rsquo;s been
using his paper to write ugly editorials. I ought to
sue him for slander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Headless Horseman episode had excited
the girls, they were tired and eager to get to
Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s. Accordingly, they cut the conversation
short and started on down the road. Mr. Burmaster
fell into step walking with them as far as the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come to see us sometime,&rdquo; he invited with a cordiality
that astonished the girls. &ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster gets
very lonesome. She&rsquo;s nervous but she means well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she does,&rdquo; Penny responded kindly. She
hesitated, then added: &ldquo;I do hope you catch the
prankster. Have you considered putting a barricade
at the end of the bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it. When we built this place we had to
agree to keep the footbridge open to pedestrians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose one had a moveable barrier,&rdquo; Penny suggested.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t your workmen keep watch and
swing it into place after the Horseman started across
the bridge? With one at each end he&rsquo;d be trapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea to be considered,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster admitted.
&ldquo;The only trouble is that my workmen aren&rsquo;t
worth their salt as guards. But we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise soon bade the estate owner goodnight
and went on down the road. Once beyond hearing
they discussed the possibility that Mrs. Lear might
have masqueraded as the Headless Horseman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was queer the way she disappeared from the
dance,&rdquo; Penny speculated. &ldquo;Granting that she&rsquo;s a
spry old lady, I doubt she&rsquo;d have it in her to pull off
the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; Louise argued. &ldquo;Mr. Burmaster
said she was a wonderful rider. Didn&rsquo;t you think that
horse tonight looked like Trinidad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, it was too dark to see! In any case,
what about the buggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear could have unhitched it somewhere in
the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t add up somehow.
For that matter, nothing about this affair does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rounding a curve, the girls came within view of
the Lear cabin. No light burned, but they took it for
granted Mrs. Lear had gone to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give a look-see in the barn,&rdquo; Penny proposed.
&ldquo;I want to make sure that our horses are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to see that the buggy is there too,&rdquo; laughed
Louise.</p>
<p>They went past the dripping water trough to the
barn and opened the doors. White Foot nickered.
Bones kicked at the stall boards. Penny tossed both
horses a few ears of corn and then walked on to Trinidad&rsquo;s
stall. It was empty. Nor was there any evidence
of a buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that!&rdquo; Penny commented.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s not been home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe Mr. Burmaster&rsquo;s theory is right!&rdquo;
Louise exclaimed, staring at the empty stall. &ldquo;Mrs.
Lear could have been the one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Plainly the girls could hear a horse and vehicle coming
down the road. It was Mrs. Lear, and a moment
later she turned into the yard. Penny swung open
the barn doors. Trinidad rattled in and pulled up
short. His sleek body was covered with sweat as
if he had been driven hard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear leaped lightly to the barn floor and began
to unhitch the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m mighty glad to find you here,&rdquo; she
chirped. &ldquo;Joe brought you home, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny replied that she and Louise had walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; the old woman exclaimed. &ldquo;I
went down the road a piece to see a friend o&rsquo; mine.
By the time I got back the frolic was over. I calculated
Joe must have brought you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise offered little comment as they
helped Mrs. Lear unhitch Trinidad. However, they
could see that the old lady was fairly brimming-over
with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, but I ain&rsquo;t one bit tired,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear declared
as they all entered the house. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
mighty stimulatin&rsquo; about a barn dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to remark that her hostess had
spent very little time at Silas Malcom&rsquo;s place. Instead
she remained silent.</p>
<p>The girls went at once to bed. Mrs. Lear did not
follow them upstairs immediately, but puttered about
the kitchen preparing herself a midnight snack. Finally
her step was heard on the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, girls,&rdquo; she called cheerfully as she
passed their door. &ldquo;Sleep tight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Mrs. Lear entered her own bedroom. Her door
squeaked shut. A shoe was heard to thud on the floor,
then another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what to think,&rdquo; Penny confided to
Louise in a whisper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the queerest old lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise had no opportunity to reply. For both girls
were startled to hear a shrill cry from the far end of
the hall.</p>
<p>The next instant their bedroom door burst open.
Mrs. Lear, grotesque in old fashioned flannel nightgown,
staggered into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Penny asked in astonishment.</p>
<p><a href="#front">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo; Mrs. Lear proclaimed wildly.</a>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>PREMONITIONS</i></h2>
<p>Penny leaped out of bed and touched a match
to the wick of an oil lamp. In its flickering yellow
glow Mrs. Lear looked as pale as a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were at the barn dance someone broke
into the house,&rdquo; the old lady explained in an agitated
voice. &ldquo;The deed&rsquo;s gone! Now I&rsquo;ll be put off my
land like the others. Oh, lawseeme, I wisht I was
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What deed do you mean?&rdquo; Penny asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the deed to this house and my land! I&rsquo;ve
always kept it under the mattress o&rsquo; my bed. Now
it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the deed recorded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t. I always calculated on havin&rsquo; it done,
but I wanted to save the fee long as I could. Figured
to have the property put in my son&rsquo;s name jes&rsquo; before
I up and died. He&rsquo;s married and livin&rsquo; in Omaha.
Now see what a mess I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the deed is lost and not recorded, you are in
difficulties,&rdquo; Penny agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t lost,&rdquo; said Louise, encouragingly.
&ldquo;Did you search everywhere, Mrs. Lear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pulled the bed half to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you look for it,&rdquo; Penny offered. &ldquo;It
must be here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the fust time in twenty years that anyone
ever stole anything off me,&rdquo; the old lady wailed as she
led the way down the dark hall. &ldquo;But I kinda knowed
somethin&rsquo; like this was goin&rsquo; to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s bedroom was in great disorder. Blankets
had been strewn over the floor and the limp mattress
lay doubled up on the springs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; the old lady cried. &ldquo;The deed&rsquo;s gone!
I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise carefully folded all the blankets.
They straightened the mattress and searched carefully
along the springs. They looked beneath the bed.
The missing paper was not to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t hide it somewhere else?&rdquo;
Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer ten years I&rsquo;ve kept that deed under the bed
mattress!&rdquo; the old lady snapped. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s been stole
all right. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s the tracks o&rsquo; the thievin&rsquo; rascal
that did it too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Mrs. Lear lowered the oil lamp closer to the floor.
Plainly visible were the muddy heelprints of a woman&rsquo;s
shoe. The marks had left smudges on the rag
rugs which dotted the room; they crisscrossed the
bare floor to the door, the window and the bed.
Penny and Louise followed the trail down the hallway
to the stairs. They picked it up again in the kitchen
and there lost it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to follow them tracks no further,&rdquo;
Mrs. Lear advised grimly. &ldquo;I know who it was that
stole the deed. There ain&rsquo;t nobody could o&rsquo; done it
but Mrs. Burmaster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster!&rdquo; Louise echoed, rather stunned
by the accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d move Heaven and Earth to git me off this
here bit o&rsquo; land. She hates me, and I hate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could Mrs. Burmaster know you had the
deed?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;You never told her, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me like onest in an argument I did say
somethin&rsquo; about having it here in the house,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lear admitted. &ldquo;We was goin&rsquo; it hot and heavy one
day, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t remember jest what I did tell her.
Too much, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady sat down heavily in a chair by the
stove. She looked sick and beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Penny advised kindly.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure that Mrs. Burmaster stole the
deed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who else would want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other person might have done it for spite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear shook her head. &ldquo;So far&rsquo;s I know, I ain&rsquo;t
got another enemy in the whole world. Oh, Mrs.
Burmaster done it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can she hope to gain?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She aims to put me off this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burmaster seems like a fairly reasonable man.
I doubt he&rsquo;d make any use of the deed even if his wife
turned it over to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear agreed, &ldquo;but Mrs. Burmaster
ain&rsquo;t likely to give it to her husband. She&rsquo;ll
find some other way to git at me. You see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing Penny or Louise could say cheered the old
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none about me,&rdquo; she told them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll brew a cup o&rsquo; tea and take some aspirin. Then
maybe I kin think up a way to git that deed back. I
ain&rsquo;t through yet&mdash;not by a long shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long after Penny and Louise had gone back to bed
the old lady remained in the kitchen. It was nearly
three o&rsquo;clock before they heard her tiptoe upstairs to
her room. But at seven the next morning she was
abroad as usual and had breakfast waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought things through,&rdquo; she told Penny as
she poured coffee from a blackened pot. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
do no good to go to Mrs. Burmaster and try to make
her give up that deed. I&rsquo;ll jes wait and see what she
does fust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime, the deed may show up,&rdquo;
Penny replied. &ldquo;Even though you think Mrs. Burmaster
took it, there&rsquo;s always a chance that it was only
misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foot tracks don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; the old lady retorted. &ldquo;I
was out lookin&rsquo; around early this morning. Them
prints lead from my door straight toward the Burmasters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply as were the girls interested in Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s
problem, they knew that they could be of no help to
her. Already they had lingered in Red Valley far
longer than their original plan. They shuddered to
think what their parents would say if and when they
returned to Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, we have to start for Hobostein right away!&rdquo;
Penny announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky if we get there
in time to catch a train home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear urged her young guests to remain another
day, but to her kind invitation they turned
deaf ears. In vain they pressed money upon her.
She refused to accept anything so Penny was compelled
to hide a bill in the teapot where it would be
found later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come again?&rdquo; the old lady asked almost
plaintively as she bade them goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to,&rdquo; Penny promised, mounting Bones.
&ldquo;But if we do it will be by train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a feeling I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be here much
longer,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said sadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about the deed,&rdquo; Penny tried to cheer
her. &ldquo;Even if Mrs. Burmaster should have it, she may
be afraid to try to make trouble for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t just that biddy I&rsquo;m worried about. It&rsquo;s
somethin&rsquo; deeper.&rdquo; Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s clear gaze swept
toward the blue-rimmed hills.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise waited for her to go on. After
a moment she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen a rain crow a settin&rsquo; on the fence this morning.
There&rsquo;ll be rain an&rsquo; a lot of it. Maybe the dam
will hold, an&rsquo; again, maybe it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you move to the hills?&rdquo; Penny asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s answer was a tight smile, hard as
granite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; on Earth kin move me off this land.
Nothin&rsquo;. If the flood takes my house it&rsquo;ll take me
with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady extended a bony hand and gravely
bade each of the girls goodbye.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise rode their horses to the curve of
the road and then looked back. Mrs. Lear stood by
the gate for all the world like a statue of bronze.
They waved a fast farewell but she did not appear to
see. Her eyes were raised to the misty hills and she
stood thus until the trees blotted her from view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>

<br /><i>RAIN</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I can&rsquo;t get Old Mrs. Lear out of my
mind, Lou. I keep wondering what happened at Red
Valley after we left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sprawled on the davenport of the Parker
home, one blue wedge draped over its rolling upholstered
arm. Her chum, Louise, had curled herself
kitten fashion in a chair across the room.</p>
<p>A full week now had elapsed since the two girls
had returned to Riverview from Red Valley. During
that time it had rained nearly every day. Even
now, a misty drizzle kept the girls indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if it&rsquo;s raining at Red Valley?&rdquo; Penny
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tear that place out of your mind?&rdquo;
Louise demanded a bit impatiently. &ldquo;We tried to
solve the mystery and we couldn&rsquo;t, so let&rsquo;s forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do try, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;I keep telling
myself Mrs. Lear must be the person who masquerades
as the Headless Horseman. Yet I can&rsquo;t completely
accept such a theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go batty if you keep on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is that everyone laughs at me,&rdquo;
Penny complained. &ldquo;If I so much as mention the
Headless Horseman Dad starts to crack jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A step sounded on the porch. &ldquo;Speaking of your
father, here he comes now,&rdquo; Louise observed, and
straightened in her chair.</p>
<p>Penny did not bother to undrape herself from the
davenport. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lo, Dad,&rdquo; she greeted her father as he
came in. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you home early for lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am about half an hour ahead of schedule,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker agreed. He spoke to Louise as he casually
dropped an edition of the <i>Riverview Star</i> into his
daughter&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;That town of yours has smashed
into print, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What town?&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s feet came down from the
arm of the davenport and she seized the paper. &ldquo;Not
Red Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Valley is very much in the news,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
replied. &ldquo;These rains are weakening the dam and
some of the experts are becoming alarmed. They are
sending someone up to look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad! I tried to tell you!&rdquo; Penny cried excitedly.
With Louise peering over her shoulder, she
spread out the front page of the paper and read the
story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it hardly tells a thing!&rdquo; she complained after
she had scanned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far there&rsquo;s not been much to report,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker replied. &ldquo;But if the dam should let go&mdash;wow!
Would that be a story! I&rsquo;m sending my best staff
photographer there to get pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pricked up her ears. &ldquo;Salt Sommers?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the <i>Star</i> can&rsquo;t take a chance on being scooped
by another paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of chances, Lou, this is ours!&rdquo; Penny
cried. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go to Red Valley with Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just a minute,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Salt&rsquo;s going there on business and he&rsquo;ll have no time
for any hocus-pocus. You&rsquo;ll be a bother to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bother to Salt!&rdquo; Penny protested indignantly.
&ldquo;Why, the very idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; Mr. Parker resumed, &ldquo;Red
Valley isn&rsquo;t considered the safest place in the world
just now. While it&rsquo;s unlikely the dam will give way,
still the possibility exists. If it should, the break will
come without warning and there&rsquo;s apt to be a heavy
loss of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not mine,&rdquo; said Penny with great confidence.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that I won three ribbons and a medal
this year. Not for being a poor swimmer either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I shouldn&rsquo;t be too boastful,&rdquo; her
father advised dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When is Salt leaving?&rdquo; Penny demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time now. But I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t let you
tag along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if we can change his mind,&rdquo; Penny
grinned, reaching for the telephone. Disregarding
her father&rsquo;s frown, she called the photographer at the
<i>Star</i> office. Salt was leaving for Red Valley in twenty
minutes, and he willingly agreed to take two passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see!&rdquo; Penny cried triumphantly, slamming
the receiver into its hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea,&rdquo; Mr. Parker grumbled.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear what Mrs. Weems has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper, it developed, had a great deal to
say. Penny, however, was equal to all arguments.
So eloquently did she plead her case that Mrs. Weems
weakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wanted an old spinning wheel for months,&rdquo;
Penny reminded her. &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m at Red Valley I&rsquo;ll
get one for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard that argument before,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems said dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see about it when I was
there last time,&rdquo; Penny hastened on. &ldquo;This time I&rsquo;ll
make it a point, I promise. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get
the one Silas Malcom has.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you must go, please don&rsquo;t distract Salt with
spinning wheels,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said crossly. &ldquo;Or
Headless Horseman rot. Remember, he has a job
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou and I will help him,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;Just
wait and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, Mr. Parker and Mrs. Weems reluctantly
said that Penny might go. Louise obtained
permission from her mother to make the trip, and
fifteen minutes later the girls were at the <i>Star</i> office.
As they entered the wire photo room, a loudspeaker
blared forth: &ldquo;All right, Riverview, go ahead with
your fire picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, what was that?&rdquo; Louise exclaimed,
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the wire photo dispatcher talking over the
loudspeaker from New York,&rdquo; Penny, chuckled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to send a picture out over the network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch and see,&rdquo; Penny advised.</p>
<p>In the center of the room stood two machines with
cylinders, one for transmitting pictures to distant
stations, the other for receiving them. On the sending
cylinder was wrapped a glossy 8 by 10 photograph
of a fire. As Penny spoke, an attendant pressed a
starter switch on the sending machine. There was a
high pitched rasp as the clutch threw in, and the cylinder
bearing the picture began to turn at a steady
measured pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complicated process,&rdquo; Penny said glibly.
&ldquo;A photo electric cell scans the picture and transmits
it to all the points on the network. Salt here could
tell you more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too busy just now,&rdquo; grinned the young photographer.
He stood beside a cabinet stuffing flashbulbs
into his coat pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we&rsquo;re traveling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt grinned in a harassed but friendly way at the
girls. He was tall and freckled and not very good
looking. Nevertheless, he was the best photographer
on the <i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we took advantage of you in asking for
a ride to Red Valley,&rdquo; Penny apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tickled to have you ride along,&rdquo; Salt cut in. He
picked up his Speed Graphic camera and slung a supply
case over his shoulder. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s shove off for
the wet country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ride by press car to Delta was far from pleasant.
Salt drove too fast. The road was slippery
once the auto left the pavement and ditches brimmed
with brown muddy water.</p>
<p>At one point they were forced to detour five miles
to avoid a bridge that had washed out. Instead of
reaching Delta early in the day as they had planned,
it was well into the afternoon before they arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I drop you girls?&rdquo; Salt inquired
wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to work fast if I get any pictures
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drop us anywhere,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spend
the night with Mrs. Lear and go home by train
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder which way it is to the Huntley Dam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you the road,&rdquo; Penny offered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
directly on your way to let us off at the Malcom place.
I want to stop there to see about a spinning wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guided by the two girls, Salt drove up the winding
hillside road to Silas Malcom&rsquo;s little farm. There
Penny and Louise said goodbye to him and sought to
renew acquaintances with the elderly hillman. The
old man got up from a porch rocker to greet them
cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well! I knowed you&rsquo;d come back one
o&rsquo; these days,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Thank ye mightily fer
puttin&rsquo; them write-ups about Red Valley in the
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t have much to do with it,&rdquo;
Penny said modestly. &ldquo;Red Valley really is a news
center these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sittin&rsquo; on a stick o&rsquo; dynamite here,&rdquo; the old
man agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about Mrs. Lear. Me and
the wife want her to move up here on the hill where
she&rsquo;d be safe, but not that ole gal. She&rsquo;s as stubborn
as a mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the Burmasters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t worryin&rsquo; none about them. They kin look
after themselves. They&rsquo;re so cock sure there ain&rsquo;t
no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you feel the situation really is serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Silas spat into the grass. &ldquo;When that dam lets
go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be no written notice
sent ahead. The Burmaster place will be taken, and
then Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s. After that the water&rsquo;ll sweep down
on Delta faster&rsquo;n an express train. From there it&rsquo;ll
spread out over the whole valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t people move to safety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at Delta plenty of &rsquo;em are pullin&rsquo; up stakes,&rdquo;
Old Silas admitted. &ldquo;The Burmasters are sittin&rsquo; tight
though and so is Mrs. Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were planning on staying with her tonight,&rdquo;
Louise contributed uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ll be safe enough,&rdquo; Old Silas assured
her. &ldquo;Water level ain&rsquo;t been risin&rsquo; none in the last ten
hours. But if we have another rain above us&mdash;look
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After chatting a bit longer, Penny broached the
matter of the spinning wheel. To her delight, Mr.
Malcom not only offered to sell it for a small sum, but
he volunteered to haul it to the railroad station for
shipment.</p>
<p>The slow, tedious wagon ride down to Delta gave
the girls added opportunity to seek information from
the old man. Penny deliberately spoke of the Headless
Horseman. Had the mysterious rider been seen
or heard of in the Valley in recent days?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove it by me,&rdquo; the old man chuckled.
&ldquo;I been so busy gettin&rsquo; in my crops I ain&rsquo;t had no time
fer such goins on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at Delta, Mr. Malcom drove directly to
the railroad station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Quigley ought to be around here somewhere,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;See if you can run him down while
I unload this spinnin&rsquo; wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise entered the deserted waiting
room of the depot. The door of the little station
office was closed and at first glance they thought no
one was there. Then they saw Joe Quigley standing
with his back toward them. He was engrossed in
examining something on the floor, an object that was
below their field of vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Quigley!&rdquo; Penny sang out.</p>
<p>The station agent straightened so suddenly that he
bumped his head against the ticket counter. He
stared at the girls. Then as they moved toward the
little window, he hastily gathered up whatever he had
been examining. As if fearful that they would see the
object, he crammed it into an open office closet and
slammed the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>A MOVING LIGHT</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Joe Quigley greeted the girls
cordially. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you again. When did
you blow into town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise and Penny came close to the ticket window.
They were curious as to what the young station
agent had hidden in the closet. However, they did
not disclose by look or action that they suspected
anything was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We drove in about an hour ago,&rdquo; Penny replied
carelessly. &ldquo;We want to ship a spinning wheel by
freight to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you to send it by express,&rdquo; Quigley said
briskly. &ldquo;That way you&rsquo;ll have it delivered to your
door and the difference will be trifling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way you say,&rdquo; Penny agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Joe went outside with the girls. Silas already had
unloaded the spinning wheel. He turned it over to
the station agent and after a bit of goodnatured
joshing, drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get this out for you on No. 73,&rdquo; Joe promised
the girls. &ldquo;Come on back to the office while I bill
it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise followed the station agent into
the little ticket room. Their ears were assailed by the
chatter of several telegraph instruments mounted
around the edge of a circular work desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many wires come in here?&rdquo; Penny asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three. The Dispatcher&rsquo;s wire, Western Union
and the Message wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny listened attentively to the staccato chatter
of one of the wires. &ldquo;D-A, D-A,&rdquo; she said aloud.
&ldquo;Would that be the Delta station call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Quigley agreed, giving her a quick look of
surprise.</p>
<p>He sat down at the circular desk and reached for
the telegraph key. After tapping out a swift, brief
message, he closed the circuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that?&rdquo; he grinned at Penny.</p>
<p>She shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;I learned the Morse
code and that&rsquo;s about all,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I used to
practice on a homemade outfit Dad fixed up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a gal!&rdquo; Quigley said admiringly. &ldquo;What
can&rsquo;t you do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>This was Penny&rsquo;s opportunity and she seized it.
&ldquo;Quite a number of things,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;For one,
I can&rsquo;t solve a certain mystery that plagues me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Quigley finished making out the way bill. His
eyes danced as he handed Penny her receipt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you admit that you&rsquo;ve met your Waterloo in
our Galloping Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit nothing,&rdquo; Penny retorted. &ldquo;You could
help me if you would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know the person who has been causing
the Burmasters so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; Quigley&rsquo;s eyebrows jerked. &ldquo;The
way I look at it, that Headless Horseman may do &rsquo;em
a good turn. He may actually save their worthless
necks by driving them out of the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning that Burmaster can&rsquo;t keep on in his bull
headed fashion without bringing tragedy upon himself
as well as the valley. Even now it&rsquo;s probably too
late to reinforce the dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what does your prankster hope to gain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask him,&rdquo; Joe Quigley shrugged.
&ldquo;This is the way I look at it. Mrs. Lear and the Burmasters
are deep in a feud. The old lady lost the deed
to her place and she figures if she moves off, the Burmasters
somehow will take advantage of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made no attempt to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. But old Mrs. Lear is convinced Mrs.
Burmaster is biding her time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all sounds rather silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it does to an outsider. But this is the serious
part. If the dam should let go there&rsquo;d be no
chance to warn either the Burmasters or Mrs. Lear.
Both places should be evacuated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why isn&rsquo;t it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because two stubborn women refuse to listen to
reason. Mrs. Burmaster won&rsquo;t budge because she
says there&rsquo;s no danger&mdash;that it&rsquo;s a scheme to get her
out of the valley. Mrs. Lear won&rsquo;t leave her home
while the Burmasters stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me something easy.&rdquo; The telegraph instrument
was chattering the Delta station call again so
Quigley turned to answer it. &ldquo;If you see Mrs. Lear
before you leave here, try to reason with her,&rdquo; he
tossed over his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls nodded goodbye and went outside. Silas
Malcom&rsquo;s wagon was nowhere to be seen, and after
a brief debate they decided to walk to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we still can catch a ride home with Salt,&rdquo;
Louise remarked dubiously. &ldquo;With all this talk about
the dam, I certainly don&rsquo;t relish spending a night in
the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Silas said there was no immediate danger unless
it rains again,&rdquo; Penny reminded her chum.
&ldquo;What Joe Quigley said about Mrs. Lear worries me.
We must try to get her to leave the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not move a mountain?&rdquo; Louise countered.
&ldquo;It would be a lot easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girls reached Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s cabin they discovered
that word of their arrival in Delta had
traveled ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your room&rsquo;s all ready fer you,&rdquo; the old lady
beamed as she greeted them at the door. &ldquo;This time
I hope you&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; fer a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing seemed changed at the Lear cabin. Mrs.
Lear had spent the morning canning fruit, and the
kitchen table was loaded with containers. A washing
flapped lazily on the line. While waiting for the
clothes to dry, the old lady filled in her time by sewing
on a rag rug of elaborate pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mite behind in my work,&rdquo; she confessed to
her young visitors. &ldquo;These infernal rains set a body
back. Fer three days I couldn&rsquo;t get my washin&rsquo;
hung, an&rsquo; I never will git my corn dried less I do it in
the oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of rain,&rdquo; Penny began hesitantly,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s dangerous to remain here much
longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is, maybe it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the old lady retorted.
&ldquo;Either way I&rsquo;m not worryin&rsquo;. There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
going to put me off my place&mdash;not even a flood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Quigley thinks that you and the Burmasters
both should move to a safer place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let &rsquo;em go fust,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear declared.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Burmaster steal the deed to my land
jest fer meanness and spite? If I was dumb enough
to leave this place fer an hour she&rsquo;d find some way to
git it away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t be done so easily,&rdquo; smiled Penny.
&ldquo;After all, Mr. Burmaster has more sense than his
wife. Did you never talk to him about the missing
deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had words,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said with emphasis.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Course he stood up fer his wife&mdash;said she&rsquo;d never
do such a thing. But I know better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet since the deed disappeared no one has tried to
put you off your land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cause the Burmasters are waitin&rsquo; their
chance. Oh, they&rsquo;re sly and cunning. But I&rsquo;m jest
as smart as they are, and they&rsquo;ll never git me off this
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion, Penny felt, was traveling in the
same familiar circle. One could not influence Mrs.
Lear. Her mind had been made up. Nothing would
move her.</p>
<p>Thinking that they might at least talk matters over
with Mr. Burmaster, the girls presently walked down
the road to Sleepy Hollow estate. A workman who
was busy with hammer and saw told them that Mr.
and Mrs. Burmaster had motored to Delta for the
afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you building?&rdquo; Penny inquired curiously.
&ldquo;A gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might call it that,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Mr. Burmaster
ordered me to knock together a couple of &rsquo;em,
one for each end of the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see!&rdquo; Light dawned upon Penny. &ldquo;Moveable
barriers to trap the Headless Horseman prankster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; nonsense if you ask me,&rdquo; the workman
grumbled. &ldquo;That fellow ain&rsquo;t been around here in
a week. Reckon he may never show up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Mr. Burmaster keeps watch of the bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night. That wife of his wouldn&rsquo;t give him
no peace if he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The workman hammered a
nail into place and added: &ldquo;The Burmasters have got
something to worry about if they only had sense
enough to realize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Huntley Dam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workman nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quittin&rsquo; here tonight,&rdquo;
he confessed. &ldquo;Maybe that dam will hold, but I&rsquo;m
takin&rsquo; no chances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise were even more troubled as they
walked back to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s home. A fine supper
awaited them. They scarcely did justice to it and
found it difficult to respond to the old lady&rsquo;s cheerful
conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She just doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that she&rsquo;s in any
danger,&rdquo; Louise whispered despairingly to her chum
as they did the dishes together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she knows,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;But Mrs. Lear
is set in her ways. I doubt anyone can induce her to
take to the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the dishes had been put away, the girls played
card games with the old lady. Promptly at nine
o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Lear announced that it was bed time. As
she locked up the doors for the night she stood for
a time on the back porch, staring thoughtfully at the
clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like rain again,&rdquo; Penny remarked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear said nothing. She closed the door firmly
and turned the key.</p>
<p>Once in their bedroom, the girls undressed quickly
and blew out the light. For awhile they could hear
Mrs. Lear moving about on the bare floor of her own
room. Then the house became quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when we&rsquo;re home again,&rdquo; Louise whispered,
snuggling down under the quilts. &ldquo;Think how
wet we&rsquo;d get if that dam should break tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking about it or you&rsquo;ll give me nightmares!&rdquo;
Penny chided. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Try as they would, the girls could not settle down.
First Penny would twist and turn and then Louise
would do her share of squirming. Finally just as they
were beginning to feel drowsy, they were startled to
hear a drumming sound on the tin roof above their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Louise muttered, sitting up.</p>
<p>The sounds were coming faster and faster now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jumping out of bed, she went to the window. Already
the panes were splashed and rivulets were chasing
one another to the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t the worst luck yet!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;It
looks like a hard rain too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise joined her chum at the window. Disheartened,
they gazed toward the woods and the hills.
Ominous warnings arose in their minds to plague
them. With an added burden of water could the
dam hold? Sleep seemed out of the question. Wrapping
blankets about them, the girls drew chairs to
the window and watched.</p>
<p>Then as suddenly as the rain had started, it ceased.
A moon struggled through a jagged gap of the clouds.
The woods and the barn became discernible once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; Louise said, covering a yawn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go to bed, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Penny gathered up the quilts from the floor. But
as she turned away from the window, an object outside
the house captured her attention. For an instant
she thought that she was mistaken. Then she gripped
Louise&rsquo;s hand, pulling her back to the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Louise asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over there!&rdquo; Penny commanded.</p>
<p>From the woods across the road the girls could see
a moving light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone with a lantern,&rdquo; Louise said indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; Penny commanded again.</p>
<p>Even as she spoke, the lantern was waved in a half
circle from side to side. The strange movement was
repeated several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; Louise whispered in
awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect someone is trying to signal this house,&rdquo;
Penny replied soberly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep quiet and see
what we can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>INTO THE WOODS</i></h2>
<p>For several minutes nothing very spectacular
happened. At intervals the strange lantern signals
were repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if that person over in the woods
is trying to signal someone here!&rdquo; Penny said, peering
from behind the window curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear?&rdquo; asked Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else? Certainly no one would have reason
to try to attract our attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should anyone come here tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls speculated upon the meaning of the
mysterious signals, they heard a door at the end of
the hall softly open. Footsteps padded noiselessly
past their door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you asleep, girls?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s voice chirped.</p>
<p>Louise would have answered had not Penny
clapped a hand firmly over her mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>After a moment the footsteps pattered on down the
stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can Mrs. Lear be going?&rdquo; Penny speculated
in a whisper. &ldquo;She wanted to make certain that
we were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls did not have long to wait. Soon they
heard an outside door close. A moment later they
saw the spry old lady crossing the yard to the barn.
She was fully dressed and wore a grotesque tight-waisted
jacket as protection against the biting night
wind.</p>
<p>Penny turned her gaze toward the woods once
more. The lantern signals had ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think is going on?&rdquo; Louise asked
in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Penny reached for her clothing which had been
left in an untidy heap on the floor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
she replied grimly. &ldquo;With luck we&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dressed as quickly as they could. As Penny
was pulling on her shoes she heard the barn door close.
She rushed to the window. Old Lady Lear, riding
with an easy grace that belied her years, was walking
Trinidad toward the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where&rsquo;s she going?&rdquo; Penny demanded, seizing
Louise by the hand. &ldquo;Come on, or we&rsquo;ll never
learn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clattering down the stairs, they reached the yard in
time to see Mrs. Lear riding into the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Know what I think?&rdquo; Louise asked breathlessly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s been pulling off these Headless
Horseman stunts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone signaled to her from the woods,&rdquo; Penny
reminded her chum. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s starting off to meet whoever
flashed the lantern!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To attempt to follow the old lady afoot seemed a
foolish thing to do. Nevertheless, Penny was convinced
that Mrs. Lear would not ride far into the
woods. She argued that a golden opportunity would
be lost forever if they did not try to learn where she
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on if we must do it!&rdquo; Louise consented.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy to keep her in sight
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their haste the girls had provided themselves
with no light. Nor had they imagined that a night
could be so dark. Once among the trees they had
difficulty in keeping to the trail that old Mrs. Lear had
chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn back,&rdquo; Louise pleaded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re apt to
get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, however, was stubbornly determined to
learn the old lady&rsquo;s destination. Though she could
not see Trinidad she could hear the crashing of underbrush
only a short distance ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I can&rsquo;t keep on!&rdquo; Louise gasped a moment
later. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m winded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared,&rdquo; Penny amended. &ldquo;Well, so am I.
But it&rsquo;s just as easy to go on now as it is to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail Mrs. Lear had taken led at a steep angle
uphill. The old lady allowed her horse to take his
time. Even so, the girls were hard pressed to keep
fairly close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Penny presently commanded in a whisper.</p>
<p>No longer could they hear the sound of Trinidad&rsquo;s
hoofbeats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost her,&rdquo; Louise said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mrs. Lear has stopped,&rdquo; Penny replied,
keeping her voice low. &ldquo;Perhaps she heard us and
suspects that we followed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More cautiously than before, the girls moved forward.
It was well that they did, for unexpectedly
they came to a brook and a clearing. Mrs. Lear had
dismounted and tied Trinidad to an elm tree close to
the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Huddling behind a clump of bushes, the girls waited
and watched. Mrs. Lear did not appear to be expecting
anyone. She gave Trinidad a friendly pat. Then
making certain that he was securely fastened to the
tree, walked briskly toward the girls.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise cringed closer to the ground.
The old lady passed them and went on down the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here and keep watch of Trinidad!&rdquo;
Penny instructed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow Mrs. Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Louise did not want to remain alone. She started
to say so, but Penny was gone.</p>
<p>The moment her chum had vanished from sight,
sheer panic took possession of Louise. An owl hooted.
The cry sent icy chills racing down the girl&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<p>Tensely she listened. She was certain she could
hear footsteps approaching the brook. Suddenly she
lost all interest in solving the mystery. Her one desire
was to get safely out of the woods. Shamelessly,
she turned and fled.</p>
<p>Penny, doggedly following Mrs. Lear, was startled
to hear a crashing of the bushes behind her. As she
paused, Louise came running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Penny demanded. &ldquo;Did someone
come for Trinidad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; Louise answered
grimly. &ldquo;Call me a coward if you like&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not stay
by myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not chide her chum, though she was disappointed.
A moment&rsquo;s thought convinced her that
since Louise was unwilling to remain by the brook, it
now would be better for them both to trail Mrs. Lear.
If they were not to lose her, they must hasten along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think the old lady is going?&rdquo; Louise
presently asked as they stumbled over a vine-clogged
trail. &ldquo;Not back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Penny agreed in a whisper, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going in
the wrong direction for that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Unexpectedly, the girls emerged into a clearing,
Not daring to cross the open space lest Mrs. Lear see
them, they huddled at the fringe of trees. Overhead,
dark clouds scudded and boiled; a strengthening wind
whipped their clothing about them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear moved spryly across the open space.
Pausing near the edge of a cliff, she crouched beside
a huge boulder. Grasping a bush for support, she
peered down into the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be directly above Sleepy Hollow estate!&rdquo;
Penny whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to get closer
and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treading cautiously over the sodden leaves, the
girls made a wide circle along the edge of trees. Keeping
a safe distance from Mrs. Lear, they peered down
over the rim of the valley. As Penny had guessed,
Sleepy Hollow was to be seen below. A light, dimly
visible, burned on the lower floor of the dwelling.
They barely were able to discern the long, narrow
bridge spanning the mill pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why do you suppose Mrs. Lear came here
at this time of night?&rdquo; Louise speculated. &ldquo;Do you
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave her chum a quick little jab. From far
away she had caught the sound of approaching hoofbeats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Headless Horseman!&rdquo; Louise whispered in
awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see. Mrs. Lear is waiting for something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minutes elapsed. Penny began to doubt that she
had heard an approaching horseman. Then suddenly
he emerged from a thicket that edged the valley road.
The rider was garbed in white which plainly silhouetted
his huge, misshapen body. Where his head
should have been there was nothing.</p>
<p>The sight of such an apparition did not seem to dismay
old Mrs. Lear. The old lady leaned farther over
the cliff, fairly hugging herself with delight.</p>
<p>Having gained the road leading to Sleepy Hollow,
the horseman came on at a swift pace. Sparks flew
from the steel shod hoofs as they clipped smartly on
the stones.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze swept ahead of the ghost rider to the
bridge. Her heart leaped. Even as the horseman
rode onto the structure, workmen sprang from the
thickets at either side of the road. High wooden barriers
were jerked into place at both ends of the bridge.
The Headless Horseman&rsquo;s retreat was cut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; Penny whispered tensely.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trapped on the bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse faltered for an instant and slackened
speed. Then as the mysterious rider apparently urged
him on, he bore down on the barrier blocking the
bridge&rsquo;s exit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to try to jump!&rdquo; Louise murmured.
&ldquo;But no one could take such a high barrier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nervously the girls watched. By this time they
were certain that the horse was Trinidad. Magnificent
though he was, age had crept upon him, and the
wooden gate could prove a difficult test for a trained
jumper.</p>
<p>If Penny and Louise were tense, Mrs. Lear was
even more so. &ldquo;Take it, Trinidad!&rdquo; they heard her
mutter. &ldquo;Over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trinidad did not falter. Approaching the barrier
at full tilt, he gathered his strength, and cleared the
structure in a beautiful, clean leap. The startled
workmen, amazed at the feat, fell back out of the
way. Only one made any attempt to stop the rider.
The Headless Horseman plunged his gallant steed
through a gap in the trees and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it Trinidad!&rdquo; cackled Mrs. Lear. &ldquo;You
showed &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stooping to pick up a pebble, the old lady hurled it
contemptuously toward the bridge. Her aim though
carelessly taken was surprisingly good. The stone
fell with a loud, resounding thud on the bridge planks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em wonder where that came from!&rdquo; the old
lady chuckled gleefully. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapping her black coat about her, she quickly retreated
into the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>A FRUITLESS SEARCH</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give Mrs. Lear a little start and then follow,&rdquo;
Penny instructed. &ldquo;Undoubtedly she&rsquo;ll return
to the brook to meet the Headless Horseman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe she&rsquo;s been behind the scheme
from the first?&rdquo; Louise asked, backing away from the
cliff&rsquo;s crumbling edge. Below, on the grounds of
Sleepy Hollow, men roved about with lighted lanterns.
Apparently no very vigorous effort was being
made to pursue the mysterious rider into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; Penny countered. &ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s
been a party to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not actually the rider. We know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly knows the identity of the man,&rdquo;
Penny said with conviction. &ldquo;And we should too before
the night&rsquo;s over. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearful lest Mrs. Lear get too much of a start, the
girls set off in pursuit. However, they had not gone
far before they realized that the old lady was not returning
to the brook. Instead she seemed to be heading
for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t figure this so well after all!&rdquo; Penny observed
in deep disgust. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s too late to go back
to the brook, so we&rsquo;ve lost our chance to learn who
the fellow is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Louise said cheerfully. &ldquo;Someone
will have to bring Trinidad home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had now reached the main road with Mrs.
Lear&rsquo;s cabin visible over the hill. Not once glancing
over her shoulder, the old lady trod a muddy path
to her own gate. Once inside the grounds, she peered
up at the windows of the bedroom Penny and Louise
had occupied. Satisfied that no light was burning,
she quietly entered the house.</p>
<p>The two girls waited for awhile in the woods.
They thought it wise to give the old lady ample time
to go to bed and fall asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ve waited long enough,&rdquo; Penny said
at last.</p>
<p>They crossed the road and stole to the front door.
To their astonishment it was locked. The back door
also was fastened from the inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try a window,&rdquo; Penny proposed.</p>
<p>The windows also were locked or so stuck by
dampness that they could not be budged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t a pretty mess!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed impatiently.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lear never used to lock anything.
She must have started doing it since the deed to her
property disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do? Sleep in the barn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might not be such a bad idea. Then if
Trinidad ever comes home we&rsquo;d be able to see who
rode him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get another idea!&rdquo; Louise retorted.
&ldquo;That old barn has rats and mice. I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep
there for a million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny circled the house, searching for a way out
of the difficulty. She could find no ladder. A rose
trellis rising along the front wall suggested that if
they could use it to reach the second story, they might
creep along the porch roof to their own room. There
at least, the window had been left unlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks flimsy,&rdquo; Penny said, testing the structure.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gingerly she climbed the trellis, trying to avoid
the thorns of a withered rose plant. She reached the
porch roof and skillfully rolled onto it. From there
she motioned for her chum to follow.</p>
<p>Louise was heavier than Penny and less adept at
climbing. The rose bush tore at her clothing and
wounded her arms. Just as she was reaching for
Penny&rsquo;s outstretched hand one of the cross pieces gave
way. Startled, Louise let out a scream of terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; Penny muttered, pulling
her by brute force onto the porch. &ldquo;Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s deaf
if she didn&rsquo;t hear that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiptoeing with frantic haste across the porch roof,
they tested the window of their bedroom. It raised
easily. But as they scrambled over the sill, the girls
were dismayed to hear Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s door open farther
down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She heard us!&rdquo; Louise whispered tensely. &ldquo;Now
what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into bed and cover up!&rdquo; Penny ordered.</p>
<p>Not even taking time to remove their shoes, they
made a dive for the big four-poster bed. Scarcely had
they pulled the coverlet up to their ears than they
heard Mrs. Lear just outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; she called anxiously. &ldquo;I
thought I heard a scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls did not answer. They closed their eyes
and pretended to be asleep. Mrs. Lear opened the
door and peeped inside. Not entirely satisfied she
crossed the room and stood for a moment at the open
window. Closing it half way, she then tiptoed out
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that a close call!&rdquo; Penny whispered, sitting
up in bed. &ldquo;Lucky for us she didn&rsquo;t notice anything
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waiting a few minutes longer, the girls slid from
beneath the covers and quickly undressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At least we learned one important thing tonight,&rdquo;
Penny observed, quietly lowering a shoe to the floor.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lear is behind this Headless Horseman escapade.
But who is the fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas Malcom perhaps. Only he&rsquo;s a bit too old for
pranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not reply. Moving to the window, she
gazed thoughtfully toward the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone may bring Trinidad back,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;By watching&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Louise cut in. She rolled back into
bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get myself a little shut-eye before
dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a chair up to the window. The room
was cold. Her chair was straight-backed and hard.
Minutes dragged by and still Trinidad did not put in
an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse may not come back tonight,&rdquo; Penny
thought, covering a yawn. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll jump into bed.
I can hear just as well from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snuggled in beside Louise and enjoyed the
warmth of the covers. A delightful drowsiness took
possession of her. Though she struggled to stay
awake, her eyelids became heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>Presently Penny slept. She slept soundly. When
she awakened, the first rays of morning light were
seeping in through the window. But it was not the
sun that had aroused her from slumber. As she stirred
drowsily, she became aware of an unusual sound. At
first she could not place it. Then she realized that
someone was pounding on the downstairs screen door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Penny nudged Louise. When that did not arouse
her, she gave her a vigorous shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; Louise mumbled crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! Someone&rsquo;s downstairs pounding on
the screen door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em pound.&rdquo; Louise rolled away from her
chum&rsquo;s grasp and tried to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>The thumping noise was repeated, louder and more
insistent. Penny was sure she heard the rumble of
many voices. Thoroughly puzzled, she swung out
of bed and reached for a robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up!&rdquo; called a man&rsquo;s voice from below.</p>
<p>Penny ran to the window. The porch roof half
obstructed her view, but in the yard she could see at
least half a dozen men. Others were at the door,
hammering to be let in.</p>
<p>By this time the thumpings had thoroughly awakened
Louise. She too deserted the bed and went to
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just see
that mob of men! I&rsquo;ll warrant they&rsquo;re here to make
trouble for Mrs. Lear&mdash;perhaps because of what happened
last night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>ACCUSATIONS</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Louise scrambled into their clothes.
As they pulled on their shoes, they heard Mrs. Lear
going down the hall. Fearful lest she encounter
trouble, they hastened to overtake her before she
reached the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s safe to let those men in?&rdquo; Penny
ventured dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I open the door?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear demanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed sharply at Penny, who suddenly was at
a loss for words.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear swung wide the door to face the group
of men on the porch. Joe Quigley was there and
so was Silas Malcom. Seeing friends, Penny and
Louise felt reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Lear, though not in an
unfriendly tone. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of waking a
body up in the middle o&rsquo; the night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Word just came in by radio,&rdquo; Joe Quigley spoke
up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a big rain over Goshen way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have told you that last night,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear
replied, undisturbed. &ldquo;Knew it when I seen them big
clouds bilin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughter get out o&rsquo; here right away,&rdquo; added
Silas Malcom. &ldquo;That dam at Huntley Lake ain&rsquo;t safe
no more, and when all that water comes down from
Goshen it ain&rsquo;t too likely she&rsquo;ll hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the people of Delta leaving for the hills?&rdquo;
Mrs. Lear asked coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some are,&rdquo; Quigley assured her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re urging
everyone who can to take the morning train. A few
stubborn ones like yourself refuse to budge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so I&rsquo;m stubborn! I suppose you&rsquo;re leaving,
Joe Quigley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. I have a job to do and I can&rsquo;t
desert my post at the depot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Burmasters? Are they leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way up to the estate now to warn
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you a bargain,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear agreed, a hard
glint in her eye. &ldquo;If Mrs. Burmaster goes, then I&rsquo;ll
go too. But so long as she stays in this valley I&rsquo;m not
stirrin&rsquo; one inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both as stubborn as one of Silas&rsquo; mules!&rdquo;
Joe Quigley said impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that
your life is in danger?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve lived as long as I have, young man,
life ain&rsquo;t so precious as some other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t listen to reason yourself, what about
these girls?&rdquo; Quigley turned toward Penny and
Louise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s face became troubled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have
to go at once,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;What time&rsquo;s that train
out o&rsquo; Delta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven-forty,&rdquo; Joe Quigley replied. &ldquo;Or they
can catch it at Witch Falls at eleven. Getting on at
that station they might find seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pack our things right away,&rdquo; Louise promised,
starting for the stairs.</p>
<p>Penny followed reluctantly. Though she realized
that it would be foolhardy to remain, she did not
want to leave Red Valley. Particularly she disliked
to desert old Mrs. Lear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Lear is determined to stay here, what can
we do about it?&rdquo; Louise argued reasonably. &ldquo;You
know our folks wouldn&rsquo;t want us to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls quickly gathered their belongings together
and went downstairs again. To their surprise
Mrs. Lear had put on her coat and was preparing to
accompany the men to Sleepy Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t leavin&rsquo; fer good,&rdquo; she announced, observing
Penny&rsquo;s astonished gaze. &ldquo;Leastwise, not unless the
Burmasters do. I&rsquo;m going there now to see what
they&rsquo;ve got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along if you like,&rdquo; one of the men invited
the girls. &ldquo;Maybe you can help persuade them to
leave the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise doubted that they would be of
any assistance whatsoever. However, it was several
hours before train time, so they were very glad indeed
to ride in one of the cars to Sleepy Hollow estate. At
the crossroad Joe Quigley turned back to Delta for
he was scheduled to go on duty at the railroad station.
The others kept on until they reached the estate.</p>
<p>Silas Malcom rapped sharply on the front door. In
a moment a light went on in an upstairs room. A few
minutes later a window opened and Mr. Burmaster,
clad in pajamas, peered down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; he demanded angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a big rain above us,&rdquo; he was told.
&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s being advised to get out while there&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster was silent a moment. Then he said:
&ldquo;Wait a minute until I dress. We&rsquo;ll talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed before the estate owner
opened the front door and bade the group enter. He
led the party into a luxuriously furnished living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what is all this?&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster asked. &ldquo;We
had one disturbance here last night and it seems to me
that&rsquo;s about enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas Malcom explained the situation, speaking
quietly but with force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And who says that the dam won&rsquo;t hold?&rdquo; Mr.
Burmaster interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the opinion of them that&rsquo;s been workin&rsquo;
on it for the past two weeks. If we&rsquo;d had money and
enough help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you rooted me out of bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came here to do you a favor!&rdquo; one of the men
retorted angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to save the dam unless
nature sees fit to spare her. But it ain&rsquo;t too late
for you and your household to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two hundred thousand dollars sunk in this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a heap o&rsquo; money,&rdquo; Silas said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t going to mean anything to you if that
dam lets go. You ought to leave here without
waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster said, pacing
back and forth in front of the fireplace. &ldquo;It was
my judgment that the dam would hold. Naturally
no one could predict these heavy, unseasonable rains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A door opened. Everyone turned to see Mrs. Burmaster
on the threshold. Her hair was uncombed
and she wore a brilliant red housecoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo; she asked her husband in
a cold voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villagers. They&rsquo;ve come to warn us that we
ought to leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Warn us, indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster retorted bitterly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ve said to you, but
it&rsquo;s just another scheme to get us away from here!
Haven&rsquo;t they tried everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no Headless Horseman scare, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
spoke Silas Malcom. &ldquo;The Huntley dam is likely to
give way at any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that for weeks!&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s gaze
was scornful. &ldquo;Oh, I know you&rsquo;ve hated us ever
since we built this house! You&rsquo;ve tried every imaginable
trick to make us leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t true, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Silas replied soberly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s angry gaze swept the group and
came to rest on Mrs. Lear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old witch who lives down the road has set
you all against me!&rdquo; she fairly screamed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s lied
and fought me at every turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear detached herself from the group. She
spoke quietly but with suppressed fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood a lot from you in the past, Mrs. Burmaster,&rdquo;
she retorted. &ldquo;But there ain&rsquo;t no one alive
can call me a witch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster mocked. &ldquo;Well,
you&rsquo;re worse than an old witch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I ain&rsquo;t a sneak thief! I don&rsquo;t go breakin&rsquo;
into folks&rsquo; houses to steal the deed to their property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you accuse me of such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know you got the deed to my cabin
right here in the house!&rdquo; Mrs. Lear accused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got it hid away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies! Ladies!&rdquo; remonstrated one of the men
from the village.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear paid not the slightest heed. Advancing
toward Mrs. Burmaster, she waved a bony finger at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a lie, is it?&rdquo; she cackled. &ldquo;Well, let me tell
you this! Mary Gibson that worked out here as maid
until last Wednesday saw that deed o&rsquo; mine in your
bureau drawer. She told me herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you say such a thing!&rdquo; gasped Mrs.
Burmaster.</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster stepped between his wife and Mrs.
Lear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of this!&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;We know nothing
about the deed to your property, Mrs. Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then prove that it ain&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; the old lady challenged.
&ldquo;Look in your wife&rsquo;s bureau drawer and
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Since you have made such an accusation
we shall by all means disprove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Burmaster started toward the circular stairway,
his wife caught nervously at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, John! Don&rsquo;t be so weak as to give in to her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear has made a very serious accusation
against you. We must prove to all these people that
she misjudged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t search&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s insulting to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again if you do! Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burmaster hesitated, not knowing what to do.
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re afraid to look?&rdquo; Mrs. Lear needled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; the estate owner said with
sudden decision. &ldquo;Furthermore, I want someone to
accompany me as witness.&rdquo; His gaze swept the little
group and singled out Penny. &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not wish to be drawn into the feud, but
as the others urged her to accompany Mr. Burmaster,
she reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s bedroom was a luxurious chamber
directly above the living room. There was a canopied
bed with beautiful hangings and a dressing table that
fairly took Penny&rsquo;s breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bureau,&rdquo; said Mr. Burmaster, pointing
to another massive piece of furniture. &ldquo;Suppose you
search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather reluctantly, Penny opened the top drawer.
It was filled with lace handkerchiefs, and neat boxes
of stockings. The second drawer contained silk lingerie
while the third was filled with odds and ends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not there!&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster exclaimed in
relief as Penny straightened from her task. &ldquo;I was
sure it wouldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the tone of his voice it was evident that he
had been very much afraid the deed would be found.
Penny&rsquo;s eyes wandered toward the dressing table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well search there too,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster
said. &ldquo;Then there can be no further accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one Penny opened the drawers of the dressing
table. Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s jewel box caught her eye.
It was filled to overflowing with bracelets, pins, and
valuable necklaces. Just behind the big silver box,
another object drew her attention. At a glance she
knew that it was a legal document. As she picked it
up she saw that it was the deed to Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster demanded sharply
when Penny did not speak.</p>
<p>Without answering, she gave him the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the deed!&rdquo; he exclaimed, dumbfounded.
&ldquo;Then my wife did steal it from Mrs. Lear! But
why&mdash;why would she do such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t realize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster is a sick woman, a very sick
woman,&rdquo; the estate owner said unhappily. &ldquo;But what
must I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do except go downstairs and tell
the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Face them all? Admit that my wife is a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that the only honorable thing is to
return the deed to Mrs. Lear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deed must be returned,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster acknowledged.
&ldquo;But not tonight&mdash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize that you wish to protect your wife,&rdquo;
Penny said quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural. But Mrs. Lear has
to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you handsomely to keep quiet about this,&rdquo;
Mr. Burmaster said. &ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll promise to
return the deed to Mrs. Lear tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster sighed. &ldquo;I suppose
I must face them. I don&rsquo;t mind for myself. It&rsquo;s
my wife I&rsquo;m worried about. She&rsquo;s apt to go into hysterics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tramping down the stairs, the estate owner confronted
the little group of villagers. In a few words
he acknowledged that the deed had been found, apologized
to Mrs. Lear, and placed the document in her
hands. Throughout the speech Mrs. Burmaster stood
as one stricken. Her face flushed as red as the robe
she wore, then became deathly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Burmaster, you&rsquo;re an honorable
man,&rdquo; Mrs. Lear said stiffly. &ldquo;I feel mighty sorry fer
the way things turned out. Maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, everyone can see that you&rsquo;re sorry!&rdquo; Mrs.
Burmaster broke in shrilly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hateful, scheming
old hag. Now get out of my house! Get out
all of you and never come back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the dam&mdash;&rdquo; Silas Malcom started to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dam!&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster screamed. &ldquo;Let it
break! I wish it would! Then I&rsquo;d never see any of
you again! Go on&mdash;get out! Do you hear me? Get
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little group retreated toward the door. Mrs.
Burmaster did not wait to see the villagers leave.
Weeping hysterically, she ran from the room.</p>

<br /><i>FLOOD WATERS</i></h2>
<p>Rain splattered steadily against the car windows
as the noon passenger train pulled from the
Witch Falls station. Penny and Louise watched the
plump drops join into fat rivulets which raced one another
to the sill. Since saying goodbye to Mrs. Lear,
Silas Malcom, and their other valley friends, they had
not done much talking. They felt too discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d decided to catch the train at Delta,&rdquo;
Penny remarked, settling herself for the long ride
home. &ldquo;Then we could have said goodbye to Joe
Quigley. We&rsquo;ll be passing through the station soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise nodded morosely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things certainly ended in one grand mess,&rdquo; she
commented. &ldquo;Mrs. Lear got the deed to her property
back, but the feud will be worse than ever now.
Furthermore, we never did solve the Headless Horseman
mystery&mdash;not that it matters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Reaching for a discarded newspaper which lay on
the coach seat, Penny shot her chum a quick, knowing
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what does that mean?&rdquo; Louise demanded
alertly.</p>
<p>Penny pretended not to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me one of those wise-owl looks!&rdquo; Louise
accused. &ldquo;Just as if you <i>had</i> solved the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I haven&rsquo;t, and never will now that
we&rsquo;re leaving the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do have an idea who was back of the
scheme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear, of course. We saw that much with
our own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t learn who actually rode the horse.
Or did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do know then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Penny denied soberly. &ldquo;I noticed something
about the rider that made me think&mdash;but then I&rsquo;d
better not say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have no proof. It would only be a guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re mean to keep me in the dark,&rdquo;
Louise pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll tell you my theory later,&rdquo; Penny replied,
opening the newspaper. &ldquo;Just now, I&rsquo;m not
in the mood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Both girls had been strangely depressed by their
last few hours in the valley. Mrs. Lear had refused
to come with them or to seek refuge in the hills.
Gleeful at her victory over Mrs. Burmaster, she had
seemed insensible to danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this headline,&rdquo; Penny said, indicating the
black type of the newspaper. &ldquo;FLOOD MENACES
RED VALLEY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the girls scanned the story. The account
mentioned no facts new to them. It merely repeated
that residents of the valley were alarmed by heavy
up-state rains which had raised Lake Huntley to a
dangerous height behind the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if Salt got any good pictures when he was
here yesterday?&rdquo; Penny mused. &ldquo;Probably not. This
is the sort of news story that doesn&rsquo;t amount to much
unless the big calamity falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the dam actually will give way?&rdquo;
Louise asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? Even the experts can&rsquo;t
agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate we&rsquo;re leaving here, and I&rsquo;m glad.
Somehow, I&rsquo;ve had an uneasy feeling ever since last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and glanced from the car window
again. Rain kept splashing fiercely against the thick
pane, half obscuring the distant hills. Along the right
of way, muddy water ran in deep torrents, washing
fence and hedgerow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>As the train snailed along toward Delta, there was
increasing evidence of flood damage. A row of
shacks near the railroad tracks was half submerged.
Along the creek beds, giant trees bowed their
branches to the swirling water. Many landmarks
were completely blotted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming into Delta now,&rdquo; Penny presently
observed. &ldquo;Perhaps if we watch sharp we&rsquo;ll see Joe
Quigley and can say goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train stopped with a jerk while still some distance
from the station. Then it pulled to a siding
and there it waited. After ten minutes Penny sauntered
through the train, thinking that if she could find
an open door, she might get out and walk to the depot.
Stopping a porter who was passing through the car,
she asked him the cause of the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;se waitin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; ordehs,&rdquo; the colored man answered.
&ldquo;Anyhow, dat&rsquo;s what de cap&rsquo;n says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conducteh o&rsquo; dis heah train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! And what does he say about the high
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says de track between heah and Hobostein&rsquo;s
a foot undeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that means the river must be coming up
fast. Any danger we&rsquo;ll be stranded at Delta?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You betteh talk to de conductor,&rdquo; the porter said,
jerking his head toward a fat, bespectacled trainman
who had just swung aboard the coach. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s Mr.
Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stopped the conductor to ask him what the
chances were of getting through the flooded area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look so good,&rdquo; he rumbled. &ldquo;The rails
are under at Mile Posts 792 and 825.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re tied up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re going as far as we can,&rdquo; the conductor
answered. &ldquo;The dispatcher&rsquo;s sending a work train on
ahead to feel out the track. But we&rsquo;ll be lucky to
make ten miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny chatted with the conductor for a few minutes,
then ambled back to the coach where she had
left Louise. The prospects were most discouraging.
At best it would be late afternoon before they could
hope to reach Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving too,&rdquo; Louise said. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s
no diner on this train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a stop gap the girls hailed a passing vendor and
bought candy bars. Having thus satisfied their hunger,
they tried to read magazines.</p>
<p>Presently the car started with a jerk. However,
instead of proceeding toward the station it backed
into the railroad yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Penny demanded impatiently.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we ever going to start?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The porter hastened through the car, his manner
noticeably nervous and tense. He paid no heed to a
woman passenger who sought to detain him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; Penny said with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wash-out, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be. Let&rsquo;s see what we can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a vague feeling of foreboding they could not
have explained, the girls arose and followed the
porter. Something was amiss. They were certain
of it.</p>
<p>Losing sight of the colored man, they kept on until
they reached the rear platform. Penny started to
open the screen door. Just then the train whistle
sounded a shrill, unending blast.</p>
<p>Startled, Louise gripped her chum&rsquo;s hand, listening
tensely.</p>
<p>In the car behind, they heard the conductor&rsquo;s husky
voice. He was shouting: &ldquo;Run! Run, for your
lives! Take to the hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was stunned for an instant. Then seizing
Louise&rsquo;s arm, she pulled her out on the train platform.
At first glance nothing appeared wrong. The tracks
were well above the river level. Between the road
bed and a high hill on the left, flood water was running
like a mill race, but the ditch was narrow and
represented no immediate danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>From far away there came a deep, rumbling roar
not unlike the sound of distant thunder.</p>
<p>Leaning far over the train platform railing, Penny
gazed up the tracks. The sight which met her eyes
left her momentarily paralyzed.</p>
<p>Down the valley charged a great wall of water, taking
everything before it. Trees had been mowed
down. Crushed houses were being carried along like
children&rsquo;s blocks. Far up the track a switch engine
was lifted bodily from the rails and hurled backwards.</p>
<p>Penny waited to see no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dam&rsquo;s given away!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Quick,
Louise! Climb over the railing and run for your life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>TRAGEDY</i></h2>
<p>Leaping over the platform railing, Penny held
up her arms to assist Louise. Now awakened to danger,
her chum scrambled wildly after her only to stop
aghast as she beheld the gigantic wall of water rushing
toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump the ditch and make for the hill!&rdquo; Penny
ordered tersely. &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passengers were pouring from the other cars, their
terrified cries drowned by the grinding roar of the
onrushing torrent. The wall of water moved with
incredible speed. It tore into the railroad yard, shattering
a tool house and a coal dock. It roared on,
sweeping a row of empty box cars into its maw.</p>
<p>Spurred by the sight, Penny and Louise tried to
leap the ditch. They fell far short and both plunged
into the boiling water up to their arm pits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s feet anchored solidly. With a gigantic
shove, she helped Louise to safety. By swimming
with the current she then reached shore a few yards
farther down the railroad right of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; she shouted to the bewildered, bedraggled
Louise. &ldquo;Up the hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling over the muddy edge of the ditch, she
raced after her chum for higher ground. Just then
the wall of water swept into the siding. As the train
was struck it seemed to shudder from the terrific impact,
then slowly settled on its side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; Louise shuddered. &ldquo;Some of the passengers
may have been trapped in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them escaped,&rdquo; Penny gasped. &ldquo;There
goes the water tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A building borne by the flood, rammed into the
ironwork of the big dripping tower. It crumpled,
falling with a great, shuddering splash.</p>
<p>With the back-wash of the flood sloshing against
their knees, the girls raced for high ground. Reaching
a point midway up the hill where other passengers
had paused, they turned to glance below. Yellow,
angry water, rising easily ten feet, flowed over the
railroad right of way.</p>
<p>With unbelievable speed the flood rolled on. In
one angry gulp it reached a long freight train farther
down the track. The caboose and a string of coal
cars were lifted and hurled. Strangely, the coal
tender and engine which had been detached, remained
on the rails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; Louise gasped in horror. &ldquo;The engineer&rsquo;s
trapped in the cab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trainman, plainly visible, valiantly kept the
engine whistle blowing. Higher and higher rose the
water. Penny and Louise were certain the courageous
man must meet his doom. But the crest of the
flood already had swept on down the valley, and in a
moment the waters about the engine remained at a
standstill.</p>
<p>So quickly had disaster struck that the girls could
not immediately comprehend the extent of the tragedy.
From their own train nearly all of the passengers
had escaped. But the town of Delta had not
fared so well. Apparently the flood had roared
through the low section, taking all before it. Farther
up the valley, directly below Huntley Lake where
the gorge was narrow, damage to life and property
might be even greater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What chance could poor Mrs. Lear have had,&rdquo;
Louise said brokenly. &ldquo;Or the Burmasters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a possibility they took to the hills in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Louise said grimly. &ldquo;The flood came
so quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the yellow, muddy waters were carrying
evidence of their work. Houses, many with men and
women clinging desperately to rooftops, floated past.
Other helpless victims clung to logs, orange crates and
chicken coops. At terrific speed they sailed past the
base of the hillside. Several shouted piteously for
help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something to save those people!&rdquo;
Penny cried desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Louise asked.</p>
<p>By this time the hillside was dotted with people who
had saved themselves. Several of the women were
weeping hysterically. Another had fainted. For the
most part, everyone stared almost stupidly at the endless
stream of debris which was swept down the valley.
No one knew how to aid the agonized victims who
clung to whatever their fingers could clutch.</p>
<p>On one rooftop, Penny counted six persons. The
sight drove her to action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had a rope&mdash;&rdquo; she cried, and broke off
as her eyes roved up the hillside.</p>
<p>Two hundred yards away stood a farmhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can get one there!&rdquo; she cried, darting
away.</p>
<p>The hill was steep, the ground soft. Penny&rsquo;s wet
clothing impeded her. She tripped over a stone and
fell, but scrambling up, ran on. Finally, quite out of
breath, she reached the farmhouse. A woman with
two small children clinging to her dress, met the girl
in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo; she murmured brokenly. &ldquo;My
husband&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; down at the Brandale Works.
Did the flood strike there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have spread through all of Delta,&rdquo; Penny
answered. &ldquo;This disaster&rsquo;s going to be frightful unless
we can get help quickly. Do you have a telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s dead. The wire runs into Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had been afraid of that. She doubted that a
single telephone pole had been left standing in the
town. Nor was it likely that the other valley cities
had &rsquo;phone service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a rope?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;A long one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the barn. I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman came back in a moment, a coil of rope
over her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send some of those poor folks up here,&rdquo; she urged
as Penny started away with the rope. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put on a
wash boiler of coffee and take care of as many as
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half sliding, Penny descended the steep hillside.
During her absence two persons had been rescued
from the water by means of an improvised lasso made
from torn strips of clothing. Others were drifting
past, too far away to be reached.</p>
<p>A woman and a child floated past, clinging to a
log. Penny stood ready, the rope coiled neatly at her
feet. She took careful aim, knowing that if she
missed she would have no second chance.</p>
<p>Penny hurled the rope and it ran free, falling just
ahead of the helpless pair. The half-drowned mother
reached with one hand and seized it before it sank beneath
the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Penny shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several men ran to help her. By working together,
they were able to pull the woman and her child to
safety.</p>
<p>Abandoning the rope to skilled hands, Penny
rounded the hill to a point providing a clear view of
the flooded railroad yard. The roundhouse, the coal
chutes and the signal tower were gone. But her heart
leaped to see that the station was still standing. Built
on high ground it was surrounded with water which
did not appear to be deep.</p>
<p>Penny turned to Louise who had followed her.
Just then they both heard someone shout that the railroad
bridge was being swept away. They saw the
massive steel structure swing slowly from its stone
foundation. One side held firm which immediately
set up great swirling currents. Any persons carried
that way would be faced with destruction in the
whirling pools of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to warn the towns directly below
Delta!&rdquo; Penny gasped. &ldquo;But there still may be time
to get a message through to Hobostein. In any case,
we must get help here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; Louise asked hopelessly. &ldquo;Any wires
that were left standing must have been torn away
when the bridge went.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Penny gazed again toward the Delta depot. Between
it and the hillside ran a fast-moving stretch of
water, yet separated from the main body of the racing
flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could get over to the station, I might
somehow send a message!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be crazy!&rdquo; Louise remonstrated. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t a chance to cross that stretch of water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could. I&rsquo;m a pretty fair swimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the current is so swift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain amount of risk,&rdquo; Penny admitted
soberly. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t stand here and wait. Someone
must do something to bring help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Penny!&rdquo; Louise pleaded. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, but only for an instant. She understood
perfectly that if she misjudged the strength
of the current it would sweep her down&mdash;perhaps
carry her along into the main body of water. Once
in the grip of that angry torrent, no one could hope
to battle against it.</p>
<p>The risk, however, was one she felt she must take.
Struggling free from Louise&rsquo;s clinging hands, she
kicked off her shoes and tucked up her skirt. Then
she plunged into the swirling water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>EMERGENCY CALL</i></h2>
<p>The current was much swifter than Penny had
anticipated. It tugged viciously at her feet, giving
her no opportunity to inch her way along the ditch.
A dozen steps and she was beyond her depth, fighting
desperately to keep from being swept with the
current.</p>
<p>Although a strong swimmer, Penny found herself
no match for the wild torrent. Only by going with it
could she keep her head above water. To attempt to
swim against it was impossible. Despairingly, she saw
that she would miss the railroad station by many
yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be swept into the main body of the flood!&rdquo; she
thought in panic. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have attempted it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too late she tried to turn back toward the hillside.
The swift current held her relentlessly. Struggling
against it, her head went under. She choked as she
breathed water, then fought her way to the surface
again. The current carried her on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>After that first moment of panic, Penny did not
waste her strength uselessly. Allowing the flood to
carry her along, she took only a few slow strokes,
swimming just enough to keep from being pulled beneath
the surface. As calmly as she could she appraised
the situation.</p>
<p>The station now was very close. Scarcely fifty
yards separated her from it, but she knew her physical
powers. Her strength was no match for that racing,
swirling, debris-studded current. She could not hope
to span the distance, short though it was.</p>
<p>Penny despaired. And then her heart leaped with
new hope. Directly ahead, a foot and a half above
the water&rsquo;s murky surface, rose a steel rod with red
and green signal targets. She recognized the object
as a switch stand, used by trainmen to open and close
the passing track switch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could reach that steel rod I could hold on!&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;But do I have the strength?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swift current swept Penny on toward the upright
rod. She took three, four powerful strokes and
reached frantically for the standard. Her fingers
closed around the metal. The swift flowing water
whipped her violently, but she held fast. Drawing
herself close to the rod, she shoved her feet downward.
Still she could find no bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Hopefully, Penny glanced toward the station, now
less than twenty-five yards away. Although water
completely surrounded the squat little building, it
had not risen to the window level. Yet there was no
sign of anyone near the place&mdash;no one to help her.</p>
<p>Still clinging to the rod, she groped again with her
bare feet. This time she located a steel rail. By
standing on it, she raised herself a few inches and
found firm footing. Suddenly an idea came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I shove off hard from this rail, maybe I can get
enough momentum to carry me through the current!
If I fail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny decided not to think about that. Releasing
her hold on the rod, she pushed off with all her
strength and began to swim. Digging her face into
the water, she held her breath and put everything she
had into each stroke. Pull, pull, pull&mdash;she had to
keep on. Her breath was nearly gone, strength fast
was deserting her. Yet to turn her head and gulp air
might spell defeat when victory was near. She could
feel the torrent swinging her downstream. She made
a final, desperate spurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet she struggled on. Then suddenly her churning
feet struck a solid object. It was the brick platform
of the station!</p>
<p>Raising her head, she saw the building loom up in
front of her. The current no longer tugged at her
body. She had reached quiet water.</p>
<p>Penny stood still a moment, regaining her breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Then she waded to the front door of the station. It
could not be opened. Penny pounded and shouted.
Her cries went unanswered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is deserted!&rdquo; she thought with a sinking
heart. &ldquo;Joe Quigley must have taken to the hills
when the flood came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Penny waded around the building, unwilling
to acknowledge failure. Somehow she had to get
word of the disaster through to the outside world.
Yet even if she did get inside the station, she was far
from certain it would do any good. Telephone wires
undoubtedly were down.</p>
<p>Penny made a complete circuit of the depot without
seeing anyone. Sick with disappointment, she
paused beside the glass-enclosed bay of the ticket
office and peered inside. She could see no one. But
as she pressed her face against the pane of glass she
thought she heard the chatter of a telegraph instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means there still must be a wire connection!&rdquo;
she thought hopefully.</p>
<p>Nearby, the flood had lodged a small board against
the depot wall. Seizing it, Penny smashed the lower
pane of glass with one well-aimed blow.</p>
<p>She scrambled through the opening, crawled over
the operator&rsquo;s table and dropped to the floor. The
little ticket office was deserted though Joe Quigley&rsquo;s
hat still lay on the counter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I knew how to telegraph!&rdquo; Penny despaired,
hearing again the chatter of the instrument.
&ldquo;Just knowing Morse code won&rsquo;t help me much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telegraph sounder was signaling the station
call for Delta: &ldquo;D-A, D-A, D-A.&rdquo; Over and over it
was repeated.</p>
<p>Penny hesitated and then went to the instrument.
She opened the key and answered with the station
call, &ldquo;D-A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been for the past twenty minutes?&rdquo;
the train dispatcher sent angrily at top speed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to No. 17?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny got only part of the message and guessed at
the rest. Nervously, at very slow speed, she tapped
out in Morse code that the train had been washed off
the track.</p>
<p>The dispatcher&rsquo;s next message came very slowly,
disclosing that he knew from Penny&rsquo;s style of sending
that he was talking to an amateur telegrapher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Joe Quigley?&rdquo; he asked in code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny tapped again. &ldquo;Station&rsquo;s
half under water. Can you send help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot me the facts straight,&rdquo; came the terse order.</p>
<p>Penny described what had happened at Huntley
Dam and told how the railroad bridge had washed
out. In return the dispatcher assured her that a relief
crew would be sent without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay on the job until relieved,&rdquo; was his final order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Weak with excitement, Penny leaned back in her
chair. Help actually was on the way! The dispatcher
would notify the proper authorities and set
in motion the wheels of various relief organizations.
For the moment she had done all she could.</p>
<p>She listened tensely as the dispatcher&rsquo;s crisp call
flashed over the wire. He was notifying stations
farther up the line to hold all trains running into the
valley. Repeatedly Penny heard the call &ldquo;W-F&rdquo;
which she took to be Witch Falls. It went unanswered.</p>
<p>Half sick with dread, she waited, hoping for a response.
It was likely, almost a certainty that the
station had been swept away, for the town would
have been squarely in the path of the flood. What
had happened to old Mrs. Lear and the Burmasters?
Penny tried not to think about it.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the outside office door opened. Joe
Quigley, bedraggled and haggard, one arm hanging
limp at his side, splashed toward the desk. Seeing
Penny, he stopped short, yet seemed too dazed to
question the girl&rsquo;s presence in the inner office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I was on the station
platform when I saw that wall of water coming.
Tried to warn the men in the roundhouse. Before I
could cross the tracks, it was too late. One terrific
crash and the roundhouse disappeared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt,&rdquo; Penny cried as the agent reeled
against the wall. &ldquo;Your arm is crushed. How did it
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Joe admitted, sinking into a chair
the girl offered. &ldquo;I was knocked off my feet. Came
to lying in a pile of boards that had snagged against a
tree trunk.&rdquo; He stared at Penny as if really seeing
her for the first time. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;how did
you get in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smashed the window. It was the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agent got to his feet, staggering toward the
telegraph desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to send a message,&rdquo; he said jerkily. &ldquo;No.
30&rsquo;s due at Rodney in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the trains have been stopped by the dispatcher,&rdquo;
Penny reassured him, and explained how she
had sent out the call for help.</p>
<p>Joe Quigley slumped back in the chair. &ldquo;If you can
telegraph, let the dispatcher know I&rsquo;m on the job
again. This hand of mine&rsquo;s not so hot for sending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny obediently sent the stumbling message, but
as she completed it the telegraph sounder became lifeless.
Although she still could manipulate the key, the
signals had faded completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; she cried, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wire&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; Quigley exclaimed. Anxiously
he glanced toward the storage batteries, fearing that
water had damped them out. However, the boxes
were high above the floor and still dry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can be wrong?&rdquo; Penny asked the operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything can happen in a mess like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching across the table with his good hand,
Quigley tested the wire by opening and closing the
lifeless telegraph key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely out,&rdquo; he declared with finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything we can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quigley got to his feet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one chance.
The wire may have grounded when the bridge was
swept away. Then if it tore loose again we&rsquo;d be out
of service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we&rsquo;re up against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Quigley replied. He splashed across
the room to the switchboard. &ldquo;If that should happen
to be the trouble, we can ground it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inserted a plug in the groundplate of the switchboard.
Immediately the sounder came to life, closing
with a sharp click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that luck!&rdquo; grinned Quigley. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s
try that dispatcher. Want to get him on the wire
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and sat down at the desk again.
Insistently she sent out the call, &ldquo;D-S, D-S, D-S.&rdquo; All
the while as she kept the key moving, her thoughts
raced ahead. She was afraid that persons had lost
their lives in the flood. Property damage was beyond
estimate. But catastrophe spelled Big News and she
was certain her father would want every detail of the
story for the <i>Riverview Star</i>. If only she could send
word to him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Quigley asked, his voice impatient.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get an answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then it came&mdash;a crisp &ldquo;I&mdash;DS&rdquo; which told the
two listeners that the train dispatcher again was on the
wire.</p>
<p>Quigley took over, explaining the break in service
and giving the dispatcher such facts as he desired.
Hovering at the agent&rsquo;s elbow, Penny asked him if the
dispatcher would take an important personal message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the <i>Riverview Star</i>,&rdquo; she added quickly. &ldquo;My
father&rsquo;s newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt he&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Quigley discouraged her.
&ldquo;This one wire is needed for vital railroad messages.
But we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tapped out a message and the reply came. It
was sent so fast that Penny could not understand the
code. Quigley translated it as &ldquo;Okay, but make it
brief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no time to compose a carefully worded message,
Penny reported the bare facts of the disaster.
She addressed the message to her father and signed her
own name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s off,&rdquo; Quigley said, sagging back in
his chair.</p>
<p>Penny saw that the station agent was in no condition
to carry on his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in bad shape,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;Let me
bandage that smashed hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find something to tie it up with,&rdquo; Penny insisted.</p>
<p>In search of bandage material, she crossed the room
to a wall closet. As she reached for the door handle,
Quigley turned swiftly in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not there!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Penny already had opened the door. Her gaze
fastened upon a white roll of cloth on the top shelf.
She reached for it and it came fluttering down into
her hands&mdash;a loose garment fashioned somewhat like
a cape with tiny slits cut for eyes. In an instant she
knew what it was. Slowly she turned to face Joe
Quigley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you!&rdquo; she whispered accusingly. &ldquo;The
Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>A MYSTERY EXPLAINED</i></h2>
<p>Joe Quigley did not deny the accusation. He
slumped at the telegraph desk, staring straight before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;How
could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;now,&rdquo; Quigley answered heavily.
&ldquo;It seemed like a good idea at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook out the garment. The whole, when
worn over one&rsquo;s head, would give an appearance of a
sheeted goblin with body cut off at the shoulders.
She tore off a long strip of the material and began to
wrap Quigley&rsquo;s injured hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known for a long time, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
asked diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure,&rdquo; Penny replied.
&ldquo;Your style of riding is rather spectacular. Last night
when I saw Trinidad leap the barrier at Sleepy
Hollow I thought I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing matters now,&rdquo; Quigley said, self accusingly.
&ldquo;Sleepy Hollow&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Mrs. Lear and the Burmasters
had any chance to reach the hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. When the dam broke, the water raced
down the valley with the speed of an express train.
Probably they were caught like rats in a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems too horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew this would happen,&rdquo; Quigley went on. &ldquo;It
was what I fought against. We tried through the
Delta Citizens&rsquo; Committee to get Burmaster to help
repair the dam before it was too late. You know
what luck we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So failing in ordinary methods, you tried to bring
him around with your Headless Horseman stunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a foolish idea,&rdquo; Quigley acknowledged.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lear really put me up to it&mdash;not that I&rsquo;m trying
to throw any blame on her. She never liked Mrs.
Burmaster, and for good reasons. The Headless
Horseman affair started out as a prank, and then I
thought I saw a chance to influence Burmaster
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that he might have come around if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was against the town from the first. She
hated everyone. Why, she believed that our only
thought was to get her away from the valley just to
trick her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;The
estate&rsquo;s gone and everyone with it. Somehow I can&rsquo;t
realize it&mdash;things happened so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a horrible disaster, and it will be worse if
help doesn&rsquo;t get here fast,&rdquo; Quigley replied. &ldquo;Fortunately,
the water doesn&rsquo;t seem to be coming higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had completed a rough bandaging job on
the station agent&rsquo;s hand. Thanking her, he got up to
test the two office telephones. Both were out of
service.</p>
<p>Presently a message came in over the telegraph
wire. It was addressed to Penny and was from her
father. Quigley copied it on a pad and handed it to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God you are safe,&rdquo; the message read. &ldquo;A
special circuit will be cut through to the Delta station
as soon as possible. Can you give us a complete, running
story of the flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a running story?&rdquo; Quigley asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Dad wants me to gather every fact I can,&rdquo;
Penny explained. &ldquo;He wants a continuous story&mdash;enough
material to fill a wire for several hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny said doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never handled a story as big as this&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had no experience
on anything so important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other person to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find Louise,&rdquo; Penny went on, rereading
the message. &ldquo;I ought to try to learn what happened
to poor Mrs. Lear and the Burmasters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Quigley argued quietly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do
anything for your friends now. Don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s
your duty to get news out to the country? Your
father expects it of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize there&rsquo;s no one else to send the
news?&rdquo; Quigley demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably the
only reporter within miles of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not really a reporter. I&rsquo;ve written stories
for Dad&rsquo;s paper, it&rsquo;s true. But not big stories such
as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Valley needs help. The only way to get it
is by arousing the public. Do I wire your father &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
or &lsquo;no&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; Penny decided. &ldquo;Tell Dad
I&rsquo;ll try to have something for him in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need longer than that,&rdquo; Quigley advised.
&ldquo;Anyhow, it&rsquo;s apt to be several hours before we get
a special wire through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the agent sent the message, Penny searched
the office for pencil and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get far without shoes,&rdquo; Quigley said
over his shoulder. &ldquo;What became of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left them over on the hillside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t go back for them now,&rdquo; Quigley
replied, gazing ruefully through the window at the
racing torrent which separated the station from the
high hill. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we can find for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rummaged through the closet and came upon
a pair of boots which looked nearly small enough for
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a boy who wore those when he worked
here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;See if they&rsquo;ll do. And here&rsquo;s
my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
need it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sticking here at my post,&rdquo; Quigley answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be warm enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He insisted that Penny wear the coat. She left the
station and waded toward higher ground. The coat
over her drenched clothing offered only slight protection
from the chill wind. With the sun dropping
low, she knew that soon she would actually suffer
from cold.</p>
<p>Penny wondered where to start in gathering vital
facts for her father. The flood had followed the
narrow V-shaped valley, cutting a swath of destruction
above Delta, and there spreading out to the lowlands.
She decided to tour the outlying section of
Delta first, view the wreckage and question survivors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Salt were here!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Dad would
want pictures, but there&rsquo;s no way for me to take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Keeping to the hillside, Penny reached a high point
of land overlooking what had been the town of Delta.
Two or three streets remained as before. One of the
few business places still standing was the big white
stone building that housed the local telephone company.
Elsewhere there was only water and scattered
debris.</p>
<p>Penny headed up the valley, passing and meeting
groups of bedraggled refugees who had taken to the
hills at the first alarm. She questioned everyone.
Nevertheless, definite information eluded her. How
many lives had been lost? How great was the property
damage? What fate had befallen Mrs. Lear and
the Burmasters? No one seemed to know.</p>
<p>Half sick with despair, she kept on. She jotted
down names and facts. Mr. Bibbs, an old man who
ran a weekly newspaper at Delta, was able to help
her more than anyone else. Not only did he give her
a partial list of the known missing, but he recited
many other facts that had escaped Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million thanks&mdash;&rdquo; she began gratefully, but he
waved her into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just get back to the railroad station and send your
story,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>Penny lost all count of time as she retraced her way
along the muddy hillside. Everywhere she saw suffering
and destruction. Her mind was so numbed to
the sight that she recorded impressions automatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>It was long after nightfall before Penny reached the
station. Every muscle protested as she dragged herself
wearily to the doorstep. During her absence the
flood had lowered by nearly a foot. However, the
current remained swift, and she steadied herself for a
moment against the building wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; called Quigley sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, come on in,&rdquo; the agent invited. &ldquo;Thought
you might be a looter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pushed open the door. The waiting room
was filled with men, women and children who
slumped in cold misery on the uncomfortable row of
seats. Few were provided with any warm clothing.</p>
<p>Penny splashed through the dark, musty room to
the inner office. Quigley had lighted a smoky oil
lamp which revealed that he had made himself a bed
on top of the telegraph desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m turning in for the night,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more we can do until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about my story to the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo; Penny asked
wearily. &ldquo;Is the special wire set up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me laugh,&rdquo; Quigley replied. &ldquo;The
Dispatcher&rsquo;s wire went out for good over an hour ago.
Too bad you killed yourself to get that story, because
it will have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it mustn&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s
counting on me. I gave my promise. How about
the telephone company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their lines are all down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Western Union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with them. Repair crews are on
their way here but it will take time. The valley&rsquo;s
completely cut off from communication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Penny, you know as much about it as I do.
The airfields are under water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open only part of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely discouraged, Penny sagged into a chair
by the ticket counter. She was wet through, plastered
with mud, hungry, and tired enough to collapse.
After all of her work and suffering, her efforts had
been in vain. By morning experienced city reporters
and photographers would swarm into the valley. Her
scoop would be no scoop at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brace up,&rdquo; Quigley encouraged carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve failed Dad. It would mean a lot to him
to get an exclusive story of this disaster. I gave him
my promise I&rsquo;d send the facts&mdash;now I&rsquo;ve failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault the wire couldn&rsquo;t be set up,&rdquo;
Quigley tried to encourage her. &ldquo;Here, I managed
to get ahold of a blanket for you. Wrap up in it and
grab some sleep. You&rsquo;ll need your strength tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged
gloomily.</p>
<p>Taking off the muddy boots, she rolled herself into
the warm blanket. Curling up into the chair she pillowed
her head on the desk and slept the untroubled
sleep of complete exhaustion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>WANTED&mdash;A WIRE</i></h2>
<p>Toward morning Penny awoke to find her
limbs stiff and cramped. Murky, fetid water still
flowed over the floor of the station. However, it had
lowered during the night, leaving a rim of oozy mud
to mark the office walls. The first ray of light
streamed through the broken window.</p>
<p>Penny yawned and stretched her cramped feet.
She felt wretched and dirty. Her clothing was stiff
and caked with mud. She scraped off what she could
and washed face and hands in a basin of water she
found at the back end of the room.</p>
<p>When she returned, Joe Quigley was awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My neck! My arm! My whole anatomy!&rdquo; he
complained, rubbing a hand over his stubbly beard.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cripple for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry
too. Anything to eat around here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a crumb. The folks out in the waiting room
broke into all the vending machines last night.
There&rsquo;s not so much as a piece of candy left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no place in Delta where food can be
bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. Only a few relief kitchens
were set up last night. They can&rsquo;t begin to take care
of the mob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny peered out into the crowded waiting room.
Mothers with babies in their arms had sat there all
night. Some of the refugees were weeping; others
accepted their lot with stoical calm. Seeing such misery,
Penny forgot her own hunger and discomfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think help will come soon?&rdquo; she asked
Quigley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went out into the waiting room but there
was very little she could do to help the unfortunate
sufferers. She gave one of the women her blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was foolish of you,&rdquo; Quigley told her a
moment later. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll likely need it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go without,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;Anyway,
I can&rsquo;t bear to stay here any longer. I&rsquo;m going to the
telephone office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building stands high and should be one of the
first places to reopen,&rdquo; Penny declared hopefully.
&ldquo;Maybe I can get a long distance call through to
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better leave some of your story with me,&rdquo; advised
Quigley. &ldquo;If we get a wire before the telephone
company does, I&rsquo;ll try to send it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scribbled a hundred word message, packing
it solidly with facts. If ever it reached Riverview a
<i>Star</i> rewrite man could enlarge it to at least a column.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to Joe, Penny made her way toward
all that remained of Delta&rsquo;s business section.
She had not seen Louise since the previous afternoon
and was greatly worried about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But I must
find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was not alone on the devastated streets.
Refugees wandered aimlessly about, seeking loved
ones or treasured possessions. Long lines of shivering
people waited in front of a church that had been
converted into a soup kitchen.</p>
<p>Penny joined the line. Just as a woman handed her
a steaming cup of hot broth, she heard her name
spoken. Turning quickly, she saw Louise running
toward her from across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! Penny!&rdquo; her chum cried joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Penny cautioned, balancing the cup of
soup. &ldquo;This broth is as precious as gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor thing!&rdquo; cried Louise, hugging her
convulsively. &ldquo;You look dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m so hungry,&rdquo; Penny laughed.
&ldquo;Have you had anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I stayed at that farmhouse on the hill last
night. I actually had a bed to sleep in and a good
hot breakfast this morning. But I&rsquo;ve been dreadfully
worried about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that goes double,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;Wait
until I gobble this soup, and we&rsquo;ll compare notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drank the broth greedily and the girls walked
away from the church. Penny then told of her experiences
since leaving her chum on the hillside.
Louise was much relieved to learn that word had been
sent to Riverview of their safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of Mrs. Lear and the Burmasters?&rdquo; she
asked anxiously. &ldquo;Have you heard what happened
to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;Joe Quigley thinks they
didn&rsquo;t have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comprehend it somehow,&rdquo; Louise said with
a shudder. &ldquo;It just doesn&rsquo;t seem possible. Why, we
were guests in Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s home less than twenty-four
hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Penny soberly. &ldquo;I keep hoping
that somehow they escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could learn the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a chance to get through now,&rdquo; Penny
said slowly. &ldquo;The water&rsquo;s gone down a little, but
not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had a boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current is still so swift we couldn&rsquo;t handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Louise admitted hopelessly.
&ldquo;When do you suppose the Relief folks will get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should be moving in at any time. And
when they come they&rsquo;ll probably be trailed by a flock
of reporters and photographers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This flood will be a big story,&rdquo; Louise acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big? It&rsquo;s one of the greatest news stories of the
year! And here I am, helpless to send out a single
word of copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that folks outside of the valley don&rsquo;t
know about the flood?&rdquo; Louise gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news went out, but only as a flash. Before
we could give any details, our only wire connection
was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the first reporter to get his news out of the
valley will have a big story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the size of it,&rdquo; Penny nodded. &ldquo;The worst
of it is that Dad&rsquo;s depending upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t expect you to do the impossible. If
there are no wire connections it&rsquo;s not your fault.
Anyhow, as soon as one is set up you&rsquo;ll be able to
send your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other reporters will be here by that time. Experienced
men. Maybe they&rsquo;ll get the jump on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Louise said with emphasis.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never failed yet on a story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is more than a story, Lou. It&rsquo;s a great human
tragedy. Somehow I don&rsquo;t feel a bit like a reporter&mdash;I
just feel bewildered and rather stunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired and half sick,&rdquo; Louise said. She
linked arms with Penny and guided her away from
the long line of refugees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; she asked after they had wandered
for some distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was starting for the telephone company office
when I met you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the telephone office?&rdquo; Louise asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s high and dry. I thought that by some
chance they might have a wire connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go there by all means,&rdquo; urged Louise.</p>
<p>Farther down the debris-clogged street the girls
came to the telephone company offices. The building,
one of the newest and tallest in Delta, had been
gutted by the flood. However, the upper floors remained
dry and emergency quarters had been established
there. Nearly all employees were at their posts.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise pushed their way through the
throng of refugees that had taken possession of the
lower floor. Climbing the stairs to the telephone
offices they asked to see the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nordwall isn&rsquo;t seeing anyone,&rdquo; they were informed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Penny persisted. She explained that her business
was urgent and concerned getting a news story
through to Riverview. After a long delay she was
allowed to talk to the manager, a harassed, over-worked
man named Nordwall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please state your case briefly,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>
<p>Penny explained again that she wished to get a story
of the flood through to her father&rsquo;s paper, and asked
what hope there was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t a single toll line at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you expect to get one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager hesitated, unwilling to commit himself.
&ldquo;By noon we may have one wire west,&rdquo; he said
reluctantly.</p>
<p>Penny asked if she could have first chance at it.
Nordwall regretfully shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relief work must come before news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no way to get my story out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest that you place your call in the usual
way,&rdquo; Mr. Nordwall instructed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell our Long
Distance Chief Operator to put it ahead of everything
except relief work messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny obeyed the manager&rsquo;s suggestion. However,
she and Louise both knew that there was slight
chance the call would go through in time to do any
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use waiting around here,&rdquo; Penny said gloomily.
&ldquo;The wire won&rsquo;t even be set up before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Leaving the telephone building, the girls sloshed
back toward the railroad. Suddenly Louise drew
Penny&rsquo;s attention to an airplane flying low overhead.
It flew so close to the ground that they could read
&ldquo;United Press,&rdquo; on the wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks as if the news boys are moving in,&rdquo;
Penny observed. &ldquo;Probably taking photographs of
the flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The airplane circled Delta and then vanished eastward.
Walking on, the girls met an armed soldier
who passed them without a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The National Guard,&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;That
means a road is open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it means that help is here at last!&rdquo; Louise
cried. &ldquo;Property will be protected now and some
order will be established!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo; Louise demanded, staring at
her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Penny said slowly. &ldquo;I truly am.
But the opening of the road means that within a very
little while every news service in the country will
have men here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve lost your chance to send an exclusive
story to the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve let Dad down,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;He depended
upon me and I failed him dismally.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>TOLL LINE TO RIVERVIEW</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Louise trudged slowly on toward the
railroad tracks. They were too discouraged for much
conversation, and avoided speaking of Mrs. Lear or
the Burmasters. Sleepy Hollow had been washed
away, but no one could tell them what had happened
to the unfortunate ones caught in the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo; Penny said dispiritedly,
&ldquo;but I know who masqueraded as the Headless Horseman.
Joe Quigley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The station agent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me about it last night. Of course
Mrs. Lear let him use her horse, and no doubt she encouraged
him in the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it to plague the Burmasters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe thought he could bring Mr. Burmaster around
to his way of thinking about the Huntley Dam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid everyone was,&rdquo; Louise sighed. &ldquo;If
it hadn&rsquo;t been for Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s stubbornness, her
husband might have given the money to save the dam.
Then this dreadful disaster would have been prevented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded absently. Her gaze was fixed upon
a stout man just ahead who wore climbing irons on
his heavy shoes. She nudged Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a telephone lineman. Probably he&rsquo;s
working on the line by the railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Louise agreed, without much interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Penny urged, quickening pace. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls overtook the workman and fell into step.
Penny questioned him and readily learned that he was
working close by at the washed-out railroad bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re aiming to shoot a wire across the river,&rdquo; the
man volunteered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be one tough little
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind if we go along?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay with me,&rdquo; the telephone man consented.
&ldquo;Hard walking though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood waters had receded from the railroad right-of-way
leaving a long stretch of twisted rails and
slimey road-bed. They waded through the mud,
soon coming to the break where the bridge had swung
aside. Debris of every variety had piled high against
the wrecked steel structure. Flood water boiled
through the gap at a furious rate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;ll ever get a cable across
there,&rdquo; Penny commented dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coast Guardsmen are helping us,&rdquo; the lineman explained.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll shoot it over with a Lyle gun&mdash;we
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise wandered toward the gap in the
roadbed. On both shores, linemen and cable splicers
were hard at work. Coast Guardsmen already had
set up their equipment and all was in readiness to
shoot a cable across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let &rsquo;er go!&rdquo; rang out the terse order. &ldquo;Stand
clear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Coast Guardsman raised the Lyle gun. Making
certain that the steel wire would run free, he released
the trigger. The weighted cable flashed through the
air in a beautiful arch only to fall short of its goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough allowance for the wind,&rdquo; the guardsman
said in disgust. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need a heavier charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun was reloaded, and again the wire spun
from its spool. Again it fell short of the far shore by
three feet. Undaunted by failure, the men tried once
more. This time the aim was true, and the heavy
powder charge carried rod and cable to its mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; Penny cried jubilantly. &ldquo;Now
it shouldn&rsquo;t be long before we get a wire connection
with the outside world!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Immediately telephone company men seized the
flexible cable, anchoring it solidly. Heavy cables then
were drawn across and made fast, permitting a courageous
lineman in a bosun&rsquo;s chair to work high above
the turbulent river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that cable should break, he&rsquo;d be lost!&rdquo; Louise
said with a shudder. &ldquo;It makes me jumpy to watch
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearlessly the man accomplished his task, suspending
a temporary emergency telephone line. Cable
splicers promptly carried the ends of the new cable
to terminal boxes.</p>
<p>So absorbed was Penny in watching the task that
for a time she forgot her own urgent need of a message
wire. But as she observed the men talking over
a test phone, the realization suddenly came to her that
a through wire had been established west from Red
Valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, they&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The wire
connection is made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could use that test set to get my news
story through to Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d still be the first to send out the story!&rdquo; Penny
went on excitedly. &ldquo;It will do no harm to ask anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Breaking away from Louise, she sought the lineman
of her acquaintance. Eagerly she broached her request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance to use that line, Sister,&rdquo; he answered
impatiently. &ldquo;Our &rsquo;phones are for testing purposes
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a very great emergency&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; the lineman brought her up short. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to put your call through the regular channels.
Regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baffled by the cold refusal, Penny turned away.
Even though she knew the telephone man had no authority
to grant her request, she was none the less annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is enough to drive one mad!&rdquo; she complained
to Louise. &ldquo;It may be hours before the downtown
telephone office will offer toll service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does no good to fret about it,&rdquo; her chum
shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; Penny muttered.</p>
<p>Her attention had been drawn to a man in a gray
business suit who was talking earnestly to the fireman
of the line gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Nordwall!&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Again abandoning Louise, she pushed through the
throng of spectators. Touching the man&rsquo;s arm to attract
his attention, she said breathlessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nordwall, do you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed at her without recognition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Penny Parker. I want to get a message
through to my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, now I remember!&rdquo; the telephone company
manager exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to send a
call through to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any reason why I can&rsquo;t use the phone now&mdash;the
test instrument?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a procedure would be very irregular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it would save hours in getting my story
through,&rdquo; Penny went on quickly. &ldquo;Hundreds of
persons are desperately in need of food and shelter.
If the public can be aroused by newspaper publicity,
funds will be subscribed generously. Mr. Nordwall,
you must let me send my story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very great emergency,&rdquo; the manager
agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited, scarcely daring to hope. However,
Mr. Nordwall kept his word. To the delight of the
girls, the call was put through. Within ten minutes
Penny was summoned to the test box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your connection with Riverview,&rdquo; she
was told. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny raised the receiver to her ear. Her hand
trembled she was so nervous and excited. She spoke
tensely into the transmitter: &ldquo;Hello, is this the <i>Star</i>
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Parker speaking,&rdquo; said the voice of her
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, this is Penny! I have the story for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard her father&rsquo;s voice at the other end of the
line but it became so weak she could not distinguish
a word. Nor could he understand her. The connection
had failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>A BIG STORY</i></h2>
<p>Penny despaired, fearing that she never could
make her father understand what she had to tell him.
Then unexpectedly the wire trouble cleared and Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s voice fairly boomed in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Penny? Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Dad!&rdquo; she answered eagerly. &ldquo;And so
is Louise! We have the story for you&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t get
it out before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we never would hear from you again,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker said, his voice vibrant. &ldquo;Your flash on
the flood scooped the country. We&rsquo;re still ahead of
the other newspapers. Shoot me all the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny talked rapidly but distinctly. Facts had
been imprinted indelibly on her memory. She had
no need to refer to notes except to verify names.
Now and then Mr. Parker interrupted to ask a question.
When the story had been told he said crisply:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done marvelously, Penny! But we&rsquo;ll need
more names. Get as complete a list of the missing as
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pictures. So far all we have are a few airplane
shots of the flooded valley. Can you get ahold
of a camera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Penny said dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try anyhow,&rdquo; her father urged. &ldquo;And keep on
the lookout for Salt Sommers. He&rsquo;s on his way there
now with two reporters. They&rsquo;re bringing in a portable
wire photo set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you plan to send flood pictures direct from
here to Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the set up,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied. &ldquo;If you
can get the pictures and have them waiting, we&rsquo;ll beat
every other paper in the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Penny promised. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a hard
assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She talked a moment longer before abandoning the
test &rsquo;phone to one of the linemen. Seeking Louise,
she repeated the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we get a camera?&rdquo; her chum asked
hopelessly. &ldquo;Delta&rsquo;s stores are under water&mdash;most of
them at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the situation seemed impossible, the girls
tramped from one debris-clogged street to another.
After an hour&rsquo;s search they came upon a man who
was snapping pictures with a box camera. Questioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
by Penny, he agreed to part with it for twenty
dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t that many cents,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;But
my father is owner of the <i>Riverview Star</i>. I&rsquo;ll guarantee
that you&rsquo;ll receive your money later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know I&rsquo;ll ever see you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just have to trust
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look honest,&rdquo; the man agreed after a pause.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave Penny the camera, together with three
rolls of film. The girls carefully wrote down his
name and address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to get our pictures,&rdquo; Penny said, as she and
Louise started on once more. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a few of
the streets. Then I want to get some human-interest
shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the railroad station?&rdquo; Louise suggested.
&ldquo;A great many of the refugees are being
cared for there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded assent. Hastening toward the depot,
they paused several times to snap pictures they
thought were especially suitable for newspaper reproduction.</p>
<p>Along the railroad right-of-way crews of men were
hard at work, but it was evident that it would be days
before train service could be resumed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise went into the crowded waiting
room of the depot. Joe Quigley had locked himself
into the inner office, but even there he was surrounded
by a group of argumentative young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporters!&rdquo; Penny observed alertly. &ldquo;I knew it
wouldn&rsquo;t take them long to get here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newspaper men were bombarding Quigley
with questions, demanding to know when and how
they could send out their newspaper copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you, boys,&rdquo; he said regretfully. &ldquo;It
will be two hours at least before we have wire service.
Better try the telephone company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then one of the newsmen spied Penny and her
camera. Immediately he hailed her. The other reporters
flocked about the two girls, offering to buy
any of the films at fancy prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Penny declined. &ldquo;My pictures are earmarked
for the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; one of the men bantered.
&ldquo;Their wire photo car broke down just this
side of Hobostein. The <i>Star</i> won&rsquo;t move in here
before night. By then your pictures will be old
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better sell to us,&rdquo; urged another.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. She wasn&rsquo;t sure whether
or not the men were joking. In any case she meant to
hold her pictures until her father released them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Between Hobostein and Delta there was only one
highway over which a car could pass. The arrival
of newspaper men led Penny to believe that this road
now was open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad told me to keep a sharp watch for Salt Sommers,&rdquo;
she said to Louise. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s post ourselves by
the road where we can see incoming cars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the pictures we planned to take
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want to snap one or two,&rdquo; Penny admitted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s embarrassing though, just to walk up to a group
and ask to take a picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls debated, the door swung open. Into
the already over-crowded room stumbled a new
group of refugees.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny&rsquo;s gaze fastened upon a haggard
woman who looked grotesque in a man&rsquo;s overcoat
many sizes too large for her. The face was half-buried
in the high collar, and she could not see it
plainly. Then the woman turned, and Penny recognized
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burmaster!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The woman stared at the two girls with leaden eyes.
She did not seem to recognize them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; Penny cried, rushing
to her. &ldquo;Your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s lips moved, but no sound came.
She seemed stunned by what she had gone through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what happened to Mrs. Lear?&rdquo;
Penny asked anxiously. &ldquo;Have you heard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Even then Mrs. Burmaster did not speak. But a
strange light came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Penny urged. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words seemed to penetrate the befogged mind
of the dazed woman. Mrs. Burmaster&rsquo;s lips moved
slightly. Penny bent closer to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear is dead,&rdquo; the woman whispered. &ldquo;She
was drowned when she saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>MISSION ACCOMPLISHED</i></h2>
<p>The information shocked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear&mdash;dead,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Oh, I was hoping
that somehow she escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me,&rdquo; Mrs.
Burmaster said dully. &ldquo;Ten minutes before the dam
gave way, a telephone warning was sent out. Mrs.
Lear thought my husband and I might not have heard
it. She rode her horse to Sleepy Hollow, intending to
warn us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as Mrs. Lear reached our place, the wall of
water came roaring down the valley. We all ran out
of the house, hoping to reach the hills. We did get
to higher ground but we saw we couldn&rsquo;t make it.
Mrs. Lear made my husband and me climb into a tree.
Before she could follow us, the water came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear was swept away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we saw her struggling and then the water
carried her beyond sight.&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster covered
her face. &ldquo;Oh, it was horrible! And to think that
it was all my fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your husband now?&rdquo; Penny inquired
kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside, I think,&rdquo; Mrs. Burmaster murmured.
&ldquo;We were brought here together in a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise went outdoors and after a brief
search found Mr. Burmaster. His clothing was caked
with mud, his face was unshaven and he looked years
older.</p>
<p>To his wife&rsquo;s story he could add little. &ldquo;This has
been a dreadful shock,&rdquo; he told Penny. &ldquo;Now that
it&rsquo;s too late I realize what a stubborn fool I was. My
wife and I are responsible for Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you mustn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Penny tried to comfort
him. &ldquo;It was impossible for anyone to predict
what would happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleepy Hollow is gone&mdash;completely washed
away,&rdquo; Mr. Burmaster went on bitterly. &ldquo;The estate
cost me a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can rebuild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall. My wife never could be happy in
Red Valley. Now that this terrible thing has occurred,
it would be intolerable to remain. I&rsquo;ve been
thinking matters over. I&rsquo;ve decided to deed all the
land I bought back to the valley folk. It&rsquo;s the least
I can do to right a great wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be very generous of you,&rdquo; said Penny,
her eyes shining.</p>
<p>The girls talked with Mr. Burmaster for a little
while and then started toward US highway 20, intending
to watch incoming cars. Ambulances, army
and supply trucks now were flowing into Delta in a
steady stream. However, midway there, they spied
a car coming toward them which bore &ldquo;<i>Riverview
Star</i>&rdquo; on its windshield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Salt now!&rdquo; Penny cried, signaling frantically.</p>
<p>The car stopped with a jerk. The <i>Star</i> photographer
sat behind the wheel, while beside him were two
men from the paper&rsquo;s news department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Salt greeted the girls jovially. He
swung open the car door. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Penny, the child
wonder! Meet Roy Daniels and Joe Wiley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acknowledging the introduction, Penny and Louise
squeezed into the front seat of the sedan. Driving on,
Salt plied them with questions. Penny told him how
rival newsmen had tried to buy her camera pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, hanging onto them!&rdquo; Salt approved
warmly. &ldquo;Our car never did break down. By the
way, where can we set up our portable wire photo
equipment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one possibility. The telephone company.
Right now they have the only wire service in
Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Penny directed Salt through the few streets that
were clear of debris to the telephone building. There
the portable wire photo equipment quickly was set
up. Penny&rsquo;s camera pictures were developed, and
though some of the shots were over-exposed there
were four good enough to send over the network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nordwall has six toll lines out of Delta now,&rdquo;
Salt told the girls jubilantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s letting us have
one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully the photographer tested the controls of
the wire photo machine. He listened briefly to the
hum of the motor. Satisfied that everything was running
properly, he attached one of the freshly printed
pictures to the transmitting cylinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he signaled to Mr. Nordwall. &ldquo;Give us a
toll to the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the order came: &ldquo;Network
clear. Go ahead, Delta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt turned on a switch and the sending cylinder
began to revolve. One by one Penny&rsquo;s pictures were
transmitted over the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your shots are the first to get out of Red Valley!&rdquo;
Salt told her triumphantly. &ldquo;Your work&rsquo;s done now.
Better crawl off somewhere and sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded wearily. She was glad to know that
the <i>Star</i> would scoop every other paper in the country
on the flood story and pictures. Still, for some reason
she couldn&rsquo;t feel very happy about it. As she turned
away, Salt called: &ldquo;Hey, wait! Your father&rsquo;s on the
wire photo phone. He wants to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Penny caught up the receiver eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Penny?&rdquo; a blurred voice asked in her
ear. &ldquo;Congratulations! You came through with flying
colors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I was lucky to come through at all,&rdquo; Penny
said slowly. &ldquo;Some weren&rsquo;t so fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now the important thing is when are you
coming home?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked. &ldquo;Can you get
here today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny, the thought of home and a soft bed was
more alluring than any other earthly bliss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly try, Dad,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;Yes, somehow
I&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Penny ended the conversation with her
father, she and Louise talked to Salt about the prospects
of a trip home. Regretfully he explained that
with a big story to cover, he probably would not be
leaving that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are plenty of cars going out of here,&rdquo;
he encouraged them. &ldquo;Why not go down to the
depot and make inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea seemed an excellent one. At the station
the girls talked again with Joe Quigley who assured
them he knew of a car that was leaving very shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry out to Highway 20 and I think you can
catch the fellow,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Hastily saying goodbye not only to Joe but to Mr.
and Mrs. Burmaster who remained in the crowded
station, the girls went outside. As they rounded a
corner of the building a voice fairly boomed at them:
&ldquo;Hello, folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise whirled around to see Silas Malcom
coming toward them. Clinging to his arm was
a spry little woman in a borrowed coat and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lear!&rdquo; gasped the girls in one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes more than a flood to wash me away!&rdquo;
chirped the old lady, bright as a cricket.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise rushed to embrace her. Eagerly
they plied her with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jest like a cat with nine lives,&rdquo; old Mrs. Lear
chuckled. &ldquo;When the flood carried me off, I didn&rsquo;t
give up&mdash;not me. I was a purty good swimmer as a
gal and I ain&rsquo;t so bad even now. I kinda went with
the current until I got ahold of a log. There I clung
until a Red Cross boat picked me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s safe arrival at Delta thrilled Penny and
Louise. They rushed into the station to bring Mr.
and Mrs. Burmaster who shared their great relief over
the rescue. And Penny was delighted when Mr. Burmaster
repeated to the old lady what he had told her&mdash;that
he intended to allow his property to revert to
the former tenants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty good of you, Mr. Burmaster,&rdquo; the
old lady thanked him. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve been through
has taught us all a bitter lesson. I&rsquo;m ashamed of the
way I acted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were justified in your attitude,&rdquo; the estate
owner acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t. It was childish o&rsquo; me tryin&rsquo; to take
my spite out on your wife. I&rsquo;m especially sorry about
the way I egged Joe Quigley onto that Headless
Horseman trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you were behind it,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Burmaster.
&ldquo;Oh, well, it all seems trivial now. We&rsquo;ll
forget everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some things,&rdquo; said Penny quietly, &ldquo;that
I doubt we&rsquo;ll ever erase from our minds.&rdquo; She turned
to the old lady and asked: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to Riverview
with Louise and me? You&rsquo;ll need a place to
stay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lear&rsquo;s gaze met hers, challengingly but with a
twinkle of humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what better place could I have than this?&rdquo;
she demanded with quiet finality. &ldquo;Red Valley is my
home, and my home it will be till the end o&rsquo; time!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
